## Customer Testimonials

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-iphone-dvd-ripper/../image/customer-ico.jpg) 

MacX iPhone DVD Ripper moves fast and does its job properly. Three steps are all I need to start the conversion process. Everything is automatic and all I have to do is pick the appropriate profile in order to reach the desired result. It converts DVD video for iPhone, iPod with fast speed. And I can choose the titles to convert as well as the subtitle and audio track I prefer.

_\- Thomas_ 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-iphone-dvd-ripper/../image/customer-ico.jpg) 

After a trial of the software, I found that it supports loading the DVD movies that can be not recognized by many other similar ripping tools, so I bought its full version with discount. It is works well more than I imagine. All my Disney animation or Paramount movies can be converted to my iPhone without any quality loss.

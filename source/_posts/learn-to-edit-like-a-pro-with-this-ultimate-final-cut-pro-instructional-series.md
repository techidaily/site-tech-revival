## Final Cut Pro Basics

 **Interface overview** 

 Final Cut Pro X tutorial starts with the interface, the most basic part. The main interface can be divided into four sections, **Libraries** on the top left, **Browser** on the right of the Libraries, **Viewer** at the top right, **Timeline** at the bottom portion the window. Libraries is where you can find all your video clips. The Browser is where you can access all the source files you import. You can play back the video clips and sources in the Viewer section, edit clips in the Timeline, which we’ll discuss later in the Apple video editor tutorial. 

**Import footage to FCPX**

You have several ways to import files to Final Cut Pro. Import files on your computer:

1. just find the files you are going to edit and select.
2. or highlight the folder.
3. or hit the event library and choose import in the pop-up window.
4. Or Shortcut Shift +Command+I also works. After importing source file, read on the Final Cut Pro guide and learn to edit your footage.

As the basics suggests in the first part, you can edit clips in the Timeline section. After you've imported source files, drag the clip to the Timeline section. 

1. cut clips to reduce video duration or remove unwanted areas: press B to choose the Blade tool from the Tools menu in the toolbar, move the skimmer to the frame in the clip where you wanna cut and click.
2. add titles, transitions, effects and more into clips: use the buttons from the Viewer. You can create titles and credits with title effects. Transitions can be fade-in, fade-out, or crossfade. Note that you can also [import and rip DVD to Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for further editing.
3. export you video from FCPX: go to File > Share, choose a destination. You have lots of options, from MP4 to YouTube. Note that you can manually add destinations in the Destinations list of the Final Cut Pro Preferences window. This is not the end of this FCP tutorial, keep reading.

## Final Cut Pro Common Issues

## ChatGPT Comes to iPhone (and Android)

 On May 18th, 2023, OpenAI introduced its own ChatGPT app for iOS via an[OpenAI blog post](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios) . According to the company, the release comes from a continued increase in user interest, especially from those who love to use the tool when on the move.

 The ChatGPT app is available for download via the App Store and is free to use, like its website counterpart. The app also features the ability to sync history across all devices. OpenAI also uses the application as a touch point for[Whisper, its voice-to-text AI-powered solution](https://www.makeuseof.com/dictate-documents-openai-whisper/) , allowing users to provide prompts via voice input.

 Furthermore, paying users can access GPT-4 and other[benefits of the ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/) on the app too!

## From Concept to Implementation: How OpenAI’s GPT-

[ChatGPT](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capture-clarity-editing-insights-for-professional-results/) and other GPT-based chatbots, like [Bing AI](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/seamless-driver-installation-for-epson-devices-on-your-pc-with-windows/), can be useful tools for pretty much anything. However, it's clear those tools still need a lot of improvement. One huge improvement is coming today, with the launch of GPT-4 by OpenAI.

 OpenAI has officially released GPT-4, an improved version of its conversational GPT AI that can, according to the research group, provide more natural, accurate, and creative responses in conversations. It's 40% more likely to provide factual responses than the previous major version, GPT-3.5, and it's also 82% less likely to respond to disallowed content. GPT-4 implements changes and feedback from ChatGPT users, which have been using the tool for some time, with the result being a safer-to-use, more accurate AI model.

 Perhaps the most impressive improvement is the ability to use images as data input. For example, you could take a picture of the inside of a refrigerator, and ask GPT-4 what recipes can be made using the items. The image recognition technology is similar to what we've seen with [Google Lens](https://www.reviewgeek.com/118881/chrome-gets-a-clean-and-simple-google-lens-update/) over the years, but fully integrated into the rest of GPT-4's abilities.

 GPT-4 is still not perfect yet, though. Microsoft confirmed that Bing Chat AI has been using GPT-4 all along, and that AI chatbot has gone viral a few times for dumb mistakes and occasionally creepy replies as well. An article from The New York Times showed how GPT-4 tried to [describe how words in Spanish are pronounced](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-new-gpt4.html), which was mostly wrong.

 This is probably just a stepping stone in the technology's journey, and it will keep being improved upon from this point onward.

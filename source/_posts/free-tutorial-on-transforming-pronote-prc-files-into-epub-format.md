The PRC format is a generic extension used by Amazon to hide what format the books are. In general, the prc format is applicable for Palm OS devices which only support .prc or .pdb extension.

On the other hand, the PRC format supports DRM protection by Mobipocket. It's not convenient for us to share eBooks with our family and read them on other mainstream eReader device.

As we all know, EPUB is a popular format for eBooks which supported by mostly reading devices: iPad, Nook, KOBO, Sony eReader etc. If you download a .prc ebook, it doesn't work on eReader. This guide will teach us how to **remove drm from prc** and **convert Mobipocket prc to epub**.

### Remove PRC DRM

If you can't open prc eBook supported by mobile application, it must be protected by DRM and can't be converted to epub directly. There is a [free PRC DRM Removal](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/)to download from Apprentice Alf blog. I am not sure that it works on all files and whether this Plugin is a safe program without any virus or not. If you want to try it, there is a way to how to [add the plugin into Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Run the Mobipocket Reader program on PDA or PC.

1\. For Palm and eBookMan, tap the menu icon in the PDA. 
2\. For PocketPC, Windows CE and Windows, go to the library and tap the "Display my PID" link. 
3\. For Psion, tap the "Help" menu and then it will pop up an "About..." menu item.

If you download unencrypted ebooks without a PID, but still can't **convert prc to epub**. What happen? Because you open them with Mobipocket Reader and it creats a copy of the eBooks including the Mobipocket Reader's PID. If you want to remove drm quickly, just find the copy of eBooks in "My Documents" folder and use the DRM removal tools.

However, The Mobipocket Reader program can't be downloaded any more on any device or pc. Meanwhile, the Mobipocket.com was bought by Amazon in 2005\.

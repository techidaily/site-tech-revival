EPUB is the most popular e-book format at present. But there are still many e-books which are not EPUB format such as MOBI, PRC, etc. So we need to convert these e-books to EPUB. Online conversion is a good choice as it's simple and easy to learn. What's more, it's free.

There are so many websites for converting e-book to EPUB that you may be confused of selecting the best one. If you choose an unreliable website, you may need to wait for a long time conversion, or just get a converted EPUB file of low quality. But this will never happen if you read this article. In this article, I'll introduce you 5 online EPUB converters and list their main features. I've tried all these online converters below so I hope my experience could help you.

**Notice: (Updated in Dec, 2019)**

To convert DRM-protected Kindle/Kobo/Google Play books to epub or convert DRM-protected epub books to any other formats like PDF/Mobi/Txt, the free online EPUB Converters may not help you since they only support DRM-free books. To get a more powerful EPUB Converter, please go to [2020 Best EPUB Converter Download for All eBook Formats (With Detailed Steps)](https://www.epubor.com/best-epub-converter.html). This is highly recommended to you if you are looking for a wonderful EPUB Converter.

### **1\. [ZAMZAR](http://www.zamzar.com/)**

![best online epub converter-zamzar](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_1-best_online_epub_converter-zamzar.png)

_ZAMZAR_ is a strong online EPUB converter. It supports converting mainstream formats to EPUB. The batch mode let you convert one more files a time. You can also enter a URL to convert online file. _ZAMZAR_ doesn't support custom option. All you can do is uploading files and clicking the convert button. But this makes it easier to operate.

One visible drawback of _ZAMZAR_ is that you can't download the EPUB files when conversion finishes. Instead _ZAMZAR_ send you an email and you have to click the link in the mail to download EPUB file.

**Input format**: PDF, MOBI, PRC, TXT, FB2

**File size limit**: 100MB

**Batch mode**: Yes

**Custom options**: No

The interface of _2EPUB_ is very concise. All you need to do are just three steps: Select files, upload files and convert them. _2EPUB_ supports many formats and batch conversion. You can save the EPUB file or download the result in zipped format.

_2EPUB_ only supports 25MB file size as maximum. So it's more suitable for small file conversion.

**File size limit**: 25MB

**Batch mode**: Yes

**Custom options**: Yes

**File access**: Download

The _Go4Convert_ has no limitation of file size. This is its most important feature. In addition, it's very fast - perhaps the _Go4Convert_ is the fastest online EPUB converter I've ever used. It uploads faster, converts faster, and operates easier â€“just select a file and the converter will do the rest. No extra clicking or setting. Just convert in one-click! 

The output file of _Go4Convert_ has smaller size than other online converters and it's not specialized for some device. In other words, it doesn't have a very high quality.

**Input format**: DOC, DOCX, FB2, HTML, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDB, PDF, PRC, RTF, TXT

**File size limit**: No limit

**Batch mode**: No

**Custom options**: No

**File access**: Download

### **5\. [EPUB Bud](http://www.epubbud.com/upload.php)**

![best online epub converter-epub bud](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_5-best_online_epub_converter-epub_bud.png)

_EPUB Bud_ supports many mainstream formats and a 200MB file size as maximum. It allows you set the copy right info and child safety. If you want to convert an EPUB e-book for your children, _EPUB Bud_ may be a good choice.

You can preview the converted EPUB file in browser or download it directly after conversion. 

**Input format**: DOC, DOCX, FB2, HTML, FB2, XLS, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDB, PDF, PRC, RTF, TXT

**File size limit**: 200MB

**Batch mode**: No

**Custom options**: Yes

**File access**: Download & Preview

Hey Jonny,

 There is also the online Epub Generator, where you can copy-paste your text directly online and generate the Epub :  
 www.spinliner.com

 It's a great and easy tool (especially for short text) to generate quickly. The good thing is that (even if it's online) it garantees that text is not kept on any server.

Hello,

 Thanks for your good suggestion, but our this article is focused on "ePub converter", not "ePub generator, so I may not add this tool to the list.

 But thank you all the same, and when writing related article, I will consider adding this tool to share with my readers.

[Re:15 Free CBZ Reader Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

thumbs up for SumatraPDF, i've tried at least 6 on this list but it's the only one i've found that can do continuous/infinite vertical scrolling, which is how i prefer to read manga and the only way to read manwha, AND the prefered reading mode on most online manga reading sites like Manganelo AND what most mobile readers do as well.  
 This is it's best and most unique feature and you didn't even mention it.  
 But being mainly a PDF reader it lacks some manga reader features like automatically opening the next chapter/volume, it's scrolling speed is also kinda slow, can't be adjusted and not smooth, it can't read images inside a CBZ file in the correct order if they are not numbered perfectly (so 001...010...100) if it's 1..10..100 you have to rename them, it also doesn't zoom in the smartest way, i zoom in quite a bit, but when i get to a doublewide page i have to zoom out, etc. With all that said it's still the best i've found, if anyone knows of a better one please let me know.

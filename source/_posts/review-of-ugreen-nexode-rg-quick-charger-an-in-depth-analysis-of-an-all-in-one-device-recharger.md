### Key Takeaways

* Ugreen's Nexode Robot GaN Fast Charger delivers on its promise of fast charging, with a maximum output close to its advertised 65W.
* The GaN technology used in the charger effectively prevents overheating, ensuring a safe charging experience.
* With its three output ports, the charger allows you to charge multiple devices simultaneously and automatically optimizes the charging load for the best performance.

 It may be a gimmick, but the digitized face of [Ugreen’s 65W Nexode Robot GaN Fast Charger](http://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is as cute as the charger is reliable. The three-port, multipurpose fast charger mostly hits the mark, faltering only with some very minor (and maybe a little picky) physical design quibbles.

 Smartphones, laptops, power banks, and mice. I ran the gamut of available devices in my office to see just what Ugreen’s Nexode Robot GaN Fast Charger was capable of. As much as I pushed the limits of its 65W output, the robot continued to smile that pixelated smile until I had nothing more to charge and it fell into a cheeky standby mode. There’s plenty of room for issues with fast chargers, but Ugreen’s GaN technology effectively eliminates the concern of overheating as the device works its magic.

 I typically enjoy Ugreen’s products, having spent time with its [Ugreen PowerRoam 1200 portable power station](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-new-wave-of-virtual-reality-finger-tech/) and [USB-C docking station](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-get-ready-to-win-more-with-this-purely-gratis-voice-modifier/). The Nexode Robot charger is another fine example of the company’s focus on quality.

##  A Friendly Face, Hard at Work

 It’s easy to get hung up on the gimmicky face that takes up much of the charger’s surface area. I had an initial gut reaction to it, having handled countless low-quality electronics that delivered subpar performance but were imbued with some sort of eye-catching albeit pointless feature. This isn’t one of those devices, though, and the main focus of Ugreen’s Robot GaN charger is definitely its output.

![Ugreen Nexode 65W Robot Charger with active digital display indicator](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/53185537315_516aa187ec_o.jpg)

 Does the charger need a quirky face? No, of course not. But who’s to begrudge Ugreen for having a little fun, especially as it churns out a fairly high-quality fast charger? And it does deliver on its fast charger claims. Even though it often topped out at just over a 60W, 15V output to my [Shargeek Storm2 portable power bank](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-secrets-for-instagram-chat-success/), the rechargeable bank went from 0% to 40% charge within 20 minutes.

##  Charge Three Devices at Once

 The Robot GaN charger features two USB-C ports, rated at 65W and 30W output, and a USB-A port with a 22.5W max output. When I split the output between the power bank, my iPhone, and my laptop, I was surprised to see how the charger optimized the load to still hit close to its listed outputs. Of course, charging times increased, but the two USB-C ports still delivered a little more than half their expected output.

![Ugreen Nexode 65W Robot Charger with 2 USB-C and 1 USB-A port](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/53185705343_2708e44bd2_o.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 Whenever a new device was plugged in, the charger would automatically determine the best way to disperse the charge. To its credit, it always distributed most of the charge to my power bank plugged into the 65W USB-C port and balanced the remainder between my smartphone and laptop, splitting them at approximately 7W each. When I removed my laptop from the 30W USB-C port, my phone jumped to receiving just over 15W.

 The GaN technology enhances energy conversion efficiency without adding much more heft to the charger. For the average consumer, this translates to a charger that won’t overheat. And while the tiny robot did get hot, it wasn’t to an alarming degree.

##  Some Minor Physical Missteps

 With how well the mechanics of Ugreens’ Robot charger work, pointing out the very few physical setbacks feels a little petty. They’re not huge detriments, though they are worth noting.

 The charger comes with a set of magnetic “feet” that cover the prongs. It’s a great safety feature, but I believe there was a better option. The cover works as intended, but it’s small and likely to be lost by the average consumer. The magnetized base does help keep it from being dropped or misplaced, but you’ll need something metal to stick it to. For all that I have in my office, only the legs of my standing desk are magnetic friendly, and that puts the small feet at the perfect height for a cat’s curiosity.

![Ugreen Nexode 65W Robot Charger with exposed prongs and foot cover](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/53185400484_2f6900100b_o.jpg)

 Yes, the prong cover fits with the whole mini-robot look, but foldable prongs would have been a little more practical. It even sounds safer, as you’d be less likely to step on exposed prongs should the charger fall on the floor. And when folded, you’d still be able to stand the robot on your desk for companionship.

 The gimmick of the robot face indicator doesn’t always work. Sometimes it would be stuck in the “charging” status when I’ve unplugged the device moments ago. It’s such a small issue that even if it were more frequent, it still wouldn’t take away from the experience of actually using the fast charger.

##  Pricing and Availability

 At $49.99, Ugreen's Nexode Robot falls in line with much of its competition. [Anker's Nano II 65W charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook/dp/B09C5RG6KV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which also features two USB-C and one USB-A port, normally sells for $55.99\. You can find cheaper USB-C fast chargers, but you'll either be losing the trustworthiness of a brand like Ugreen or its features. For example, you can find an [Amazon Basic's 65W charger](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-One-Port-Charger-Laptops-Delivery/dp/B087MFLLCR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) for just over $20, but it's only one port. And, of course, you're going to be giving up that friendly robotic smile.

 If you want to stick with Ugreen but need to save a little money or don't need a 65W output or multiple ports, the company does offer a [30W charger at $25.99](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C39ZC13B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) with one USB-C output. Designed with the same GaN technology and digital face, the 30W charger doesn't change much from its more powerful alternative. There is a more [adorable purple option](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C39ZC13B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), though, which is a nice alternative for kids or anyone looking for a little style in their fast charger.

##  Should You Buy Ugreen’s Nexode RG Robot Fast Charger?

 If you’re in need of a multifunction charger that delivers on the fast speeds it promises, then yes, you should consider buying [Ugreen’s Nexode Robot GaN Fast Charger](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000534&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-rg-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). The gimmick of the digital robot face is cute, and even when it doesn’t display the proper status, it doesn’t take away from the important functionality. Most rechargeable devices already have a built-in indicator letting you know the device is being actively charged. The “foot” base design that completes the robot’s look is cute, but foldable prongs are more practical for general purposes.

 Too often I’ve tested chargers that promise a specific watt output and fail to even come close. That wasn’t the case with the Nexode Robot GaN Fast Charger. Even with both USB-C ports and the USB-A port in use, the maximum output remained close to the overall advertised 65W. Pushed to its limits, the charger didn’t even get extremely hot, as fast chargers can tend to do. Don’t get me wrong—the charger gets hot, but the GaN technology optimizes heat dissipation to prevent issues within the relatively small charger.

 Whether you like when your technology smiles back at you or you need a fast charger that’s actually fast, Ugreen’s tiny robot alternative should be on your radar.

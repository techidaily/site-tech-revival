Just the top icons on the menu draw your attention. Click the first icon, and you will enter the video download window.

Grounded on the comparison on the table, you can have a basic acquaintance with the listed [free video downloader for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Certainly, there is no enough room to introduce their features in detail in the table. In terms of the highlights of the above Mac video downloader freeware, the following part will give you a deep exposition. 

###  MacX YouTube Downloader

Downloading video can't make the video software extraordinary. What makes it special and useful is its various video sites supported, including YouTube, Facebook, Dailymotion, Myspace, Metacafe, Instagram, Vimeo, Vevo, etc. Plus, not all the free YouTube downloaders support you to play video for a preview. This Mac video downloader freeware enables you to play any video and extract pictures from video as png format.

 If there is any downside to this YouTube downloader app, it's that it can't convert downloaded video format. And in case you need the video conversion feature, you can consider its advanced version **MacX Video Converter Pro** to convert video to MP4 MOV MKV AVI FLV, etc. 180+ video, 14+ audio and 350+ mobile devices.

###  Keepvid

Keepvid is easy use for anyone who is even a green hand to video downloader. Needless to download video downloader software or install any plug-ins, you just finish the video downloading process on the web browser. It's really nice and useful. Yet, where this free online video downloader falls down is that it can't download 4K video from YouTube in full video. 4K video downloading is available only when you ditch away the audio. 

![Mac free video downloader - keepvid](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/keepvid-ytd.jpg)

### YTD Video Downloader for Mac

As a free YouTube video downloader freeware, YTD downloader for Mac is qualified. It can free download videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Pornhub, etc. 48 sites. Yet, as you can see from the picture, this Mac video downloader is built-in with so many annoying ads, e.g., the Valentine's Day sale, YTD pro version, etc. And another point it needs to fix is its installation problem. I download this app from its official site and encounter 4 times failure on app installation, but eventually I download this dmg from donwload.cnet and successfully install it. 

![Mac free YouTube downloader - YTD video downloader](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/ytd-review-2.jpg)

### iGetter for Mac

With 3.5 scores out of 5 on download.cnet, this video downloader for Mac free program is not so famous as the previous ones. It's true that it doesn't support as many as video sites as MacX YouTube Downloader or not simple as Keepvid. But what it's worth a mention is that it not only allows you to [free download video from YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), but also download other files like dmg, zip, PDF from sites. And its Site Explorer expends your search to the entire website (http or https) and even FTP.

## Test of Performance

Above comparison is based on the product features. Now we'd use the specific video downloading test to improve their video downloading speed and quality.

The video downloading speed is decided by varied factors, including the computer hardware, the current network condition, the running tasks, etc. Keepvid, as a online video downloading service, is affected mostly by the network condition. So this test speed reflects a general speed level, not the abosolute speed. Of course, **MacX YouTube Downloader** wins this speed test compaign, mainly thanks to its multi-core CPU (up to 8) utility. Thus, it can utilize 4 CPU cores on this Intel Core i5 iMac to finish the video downloading task. So it runs a little faster than others. Well, it's more sensible if we test more videos like 4K video, virtual reality video. Unfortunately, Keepvid currently can't digest 4K video and YTD downloader can't deal with 8K video downloading. 

None is perfect. It still has large space to get improved. If you have used an even better [Mac free YouTube downloader](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), welcome to E-mail us and share with us. We will absorb the quintessence and keep on improving it.

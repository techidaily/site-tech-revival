## Comparison: DVD Region Killer VS MacX DVD Ripper Pro

### **1\. Interface**

### **2\. Platform**

In terms of platform, these two tools begin to differ. DVD Region Killer runs to unlock DVD region code on all Windows platforms, for example, Windows 10/8/7/XP etc. However, the DVD Region converter is a [DVD decrypter Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) compatible for El Capitan/macOS Sierra or any earlier version from Mac OS X 10.5\. Of course, the alternative to DVD Region Killer also supports Windows users to make DVD region-free with the help of its [Windows version](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

### **3\. Input & Output Features** 

As for input and output features, the both DVD region converters run in opposite directions as well. DVD Region Killer allows you to remove DVD region code only in DVD discs. And there is nothing change of the output after using the lightweight software.

## Additional Info: Why DVD Is Encrypted With Region Code?

Why won't a DVD Player [play DVDs in different regions](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)? Actually, DVDs are region coded to prevent people in one area from buying DVD before it's officially released in another one. In other words, it's for to maximizing world profits for film makers.

* Region 6 - Mainland China
* Region 7 - Reserved for unspecified special use

### How to Convert 24/30FPS to 60FPS (or Vice Versa) in Batch with MacX Video Converter Pro 

**Step 1\. Add source video file**.

 Run the video frame rate converter after download it on Mac or Windows. Click **Add Video** button, and choose source video file from the popping up window to load it to the program. You can also directly drag drop files to the window with 1GB, 5GB, 10GB, whatever file size. Batch conversion is available, too.

![Change video format and frame rate](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/step-image/mvcp-format-700.jpg) 

**Step 2\. Choose an output format for your video.** 

 An Output Profile window will pop up when the source video is loaded successfully, allowing you to convert video formats. The FPS changer can also be served as a [video converter for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to convert video to 420+ formats. Select your desired format like **MP4 H.264** and click OK. 

**Step 3\. Select frame rate 60FPS as your desired FPS**.

Click settings icon on the right of the video info, you'll see a window with Output Profile, Video Options and Audio options. Head to Video Options, locate to Frame Rate, and pick **60FPS frame rate** you want. Click "OK" to save the settings.

![Convert 30FPS to 60FPS](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/step-image/mvcp-60fps-700.jpg) 

In the meantime, you can compress video size, [convert bitrate](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), change video codec, modify aspect ratio, [convert video resolution](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), adjust other video audio parameters and merge/split video files with the all-around frame rate changer.

**Step 4\. Start processing frame rate 30FPS to 60FPS conversion**.

 After you've all set, click "RUN" button on the bottom right corner to start lossless video frame rate conversion. 

The same also applies to reduce video frame rate like 1080p 240FPS to 120FPS slow motion, 120FPS to 60FPS, 4K 60FPS to 4K 30FPS to properly strike a balance between quality and file size.

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

It's not good to convert frame rate to an even lower one, for example 30FPS to 24FPS, because you may lose motion information contained on these frame rates you throw away, which will result in video stuttering/jerky playback. We always use frame rate converter to change the lower frame rate to the higher one. If you have to reduce frame rate, make sure that you convert A to B, and A can be evenly divided by B, for example, convert 60fps to 30fps, 120fps to 60fps, to avoid jerk/messed video audio or other problems with output videos.

## #2\. HandBrake

Handbrake is a popular open-source video converter, attached with FPS changing feature available for multiple platforms. It can convert video from nealy any format to MP4, WebM, MKV and offer frame rate conversion option with customizable settings. The HandBrake frame rate option ranges from 5 to 120FPS, which satisfies the majority of people's requirements for frame rate in video production. 

Also, HandBrake has filters to sharpen, rotate, flip, add ASS/SRT/SSA subtitles to videos, remove the appearance of noise and grain, and more. However, it lacks real-time conversion capabilities and may require additional configuration for optimal frame rate conversion.

### **How to Change the Frame Rate of a Video in HandBrake** 

**Step 1\. Download and install Handbrake.**

Go to <https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php> in a web browser, then click Download (64 bit) for Windows 10, or Download (Universal) for macOS 10.13 or higher. Follow the install instructions and open it. 

**Step 2\. Import your video to HandBrake.** 

When you first open Handbrake, it asks you to drag and drop a video file into the box on the right. Just use File Explorer or Finder to navigate to the location of the video file you want to change the frame rate for. Drag and drop it into the box.

**Step 3\. Choose an output format for your video.** 

Go to the **Video** tab, and drop down the list of **Format** to choose an output format like MP4\. 

![change FPS in handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/handbrake-framerate.jpg) 

**Step 4\. Select a new frame rate.** 

Use the "Framerate (FPS)" drop-down menu to select a new frame rate. 24 to 30 frames per second is a respectable average frame rate. Any frame rate less than 20 fps will produce jerky video movements.

**Step 5\. Start encode.** 

Click Start Encode button to start encoding the video at the frame rate you selected.

## #3\. SmoothVideo Project

SmoothVideo Project (SVP) is a notable frame rate converter that utilizes motion interpolation techniques to enhance video playback. It aims to provide smoother and more fluid motion by generating additional frames between the original frames of a video. By analyzing the motion in each frame, SVP intelligently creates intermediate frames, resulting in an increased frame rate and improved visual quality.

One of the key advantages of SmoothVideo Project is its real-time conversion capability. It works seamlessly with popular media players, allowing users to experience smoother playback without the need for pre-conversion or rendering. 

### **How to change FPS using SmoothVideo Project**

NO, it doesn't! Oppositely, the higher the frame rate, the slower the slow motion will be.

###  6\. Frame rates comparison: is higher fps better for video?

The higher the frame rate, the better quality you will get in video (as well as game). But video is not only about frame rate. You need to take other elements into consideration. The most related one is file size. Thus, though higher FPS yields better quality, the high FPS is not always the option for video recording, sharing, editing and playing. Instead, other lower FPS options are also widely used grounded on different scenarios. Check the details:

* **24fps**, a widely accepted FPS for digital filmmaking. It keeps a good balance between image quality and film fluidity.
* **23.98 fps**, it's compatible with NTSC devices. Many HD video formats and some SD formats are recorded at 23.98fps.
* **29.97fps**, it's a NTSC standard. If you need to modify fps for NTSC devices, NTSC DVDs, choose 29.97fps.
* **30fps**, Some HD cameras support to shoot videos at 30fps. But Blu-ray disc and DVDs don't accept 30fps.
* **60fps**, 59.94fps is always referred to 60fps. Most HD devices can play and record videos at 60fps. But 59.94fps is a more common since 59.94 is compatible with NTSC.

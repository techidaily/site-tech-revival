## How Much Space Does iPhone 4K Video Consume at 24/30/60FPS

**1 Minute of an iPhone 4K Video**

* 1 minute of 4K at 24FPS will takep up **270MB** for H264 and 135MB for HEVC/H265.
* 1 minute of 4K at 30FPS will take up about **350MB** for H264 and 175MB for HEVC.
* 1 minute of 4K at 60FPS will take up approximately **400MB** for HEVC.

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

1\. to save iPhone space, generally Apple won't allow you to [record 4K 60FPS video on iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) unless you turn on and use HEVC codec for 4K recording.  
 2\. Once you upgrade your iOS 10 to iOS 11 on iPhone 7/7 Plus, the 4K video recording will be automatically running at HEVC codec to save space up to 50%.

**1 Hour of an iPhone 4K Video**

* 1 Hour of 4K at 24FPS takes up around 15.8GB for H264 and **7.9GB** for HEVC/H265.
* 1 Hour of 4K at 30FPS consumes about 20.5GB for H264 and **10.3GB** for HEVC.
* 1 Hour of 4K at 60FPS hogs up space approximately **23.4GB** for HEVC.

Now, based on your iPhone space capability, you know how long of the 4K video your iPhone can store without eating up all your iPhone space. If you're not sure about the frame rate your iPhone 4K recording supports, check the following part with specific iPhone model, 4K video frame rate and maximum 4K video length.

**Suggested 4K video length at 24FPS:**

* iPhone (64GB): about 8 hours in HEVC.
* iPhone (256GB): about 32 hours in HEVC.

**Suggested 4K video length at 30FPS:**

* iPhone (16GB-128GB): about 30 mins in H264 codec for 16GB version; 1 hour for 32GB; 2 hours for 64GB; 5 hours for 128GB.
* Note: iPhone 6s/6s Plus only supports 4K video recording in H264 codec, HEVC unsupported.
* iPhone (32GB-256GB): about 2 hours in HEVC for 32GB version; 10 hours for 128GB; 20-22 hours for 256GB.
* iPhone (64GB-256GB): about 4 hours in HEVC for 64GB; 20-22 hours for 256GB.

**Suggested 4K video length at 60FPS:**

* iPhone: 1.5 hours in HEVC for 64GB; 7-8 hours for 256GB.

If you are recording videos with higher bit rates or using professional codecs like Apple's ProRes, the file sizes can be significantly larger.

## 4K Video File Size at Different Bit Rates

Below are some approximate file size estimates for 4K videos at different bit rates. The file size of 4K videos can vary based on several factors, including the length of the video, the compression codec used, and the bit rate settings. Generally, 4K videos have larger file sizes compared to lower resolutions due to their higher pixel count and overall image quality.

4K at 24 FPS, using H.264 codec:

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 90 MB per minute.  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 225 MB per minute.  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 450 MB per minute.

4K at 30 FPS, using H.264 codec:

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 110 MB per minute.  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 275 MB per minute.  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 550 MB per minute.

4K at 60 FPS, using H.264 codec:

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 220 MB per minute.  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 550 MB per minute.  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 1.1 GB per minute.

## 4K Video Is Really Space-Hogging. I Need to Compress It

Compared with 1080p or 720p, 4K Ultra HD video is really space-hogging, which can instantly eat up your iPhone free space as you can see from the above list. If your iPhone has enough space like 256GB, then you can save about 20-hour 4K video at 30FPS. What if your iPhone only has 32GB or 64GB space in total? You'd better to [compress 4K video to 1080p](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or reduce 4K video file size if you don't wanna take forever to upload 4K video to YouTube or directly delete large-sized 4K video to free up space. And to compress 4K video file size, there are several ways to reach this goal. No matter which way to go, the primary condition is to find a solid 4K video processing software. The world's No.1 fast 4K video converter - [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is the very one you need.

## FAQs about 4K Video File Size

**How big is a 1hour 4K video?**

The file size of a 1-hour 4K video can vary depending on the compression settings and video codec used. Typically, at standard bit rates, a 1-hour 4K video can be expected to range from approximately 45 GB to 110 GB. This estimate is based on using the H.264 or HEVC (H.265) codecs with bit rates between 50 Mbps to 100 Mbps.

However, if a more efficient codec like HEVC is utilized, the file size might be on the lower end of the range due to better compression. On the other hand, if higher bit rates or less efficient codecs are used, the file size may be closer to the higher end.

**How many GB is 1 minute of 4K video?**

The file size of 1 minute of 4K video can vary based on several factors, including the compression settings, codec used, and bit rate. Here are approximate file size estimates for 1 minute of 4K video at different bit rates using the H.264 codec:

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 90 MB to 110 MB  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 225 MB to 275 MB  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 450 MB to 550 MB

If a more efficient codec like HEVC (H.265) is used, the file size might be smaller compared to the estimates provided above.

**How many GB is 20 minute of 4K video?**

Using the H.264 codec as an example, here are approximate file size estimates for 20 minutes of 4K video at different bit rates:

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 1.8 GB to 2.2 GB  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 4.5 GB to 5.5 GB  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 9 GB to 11 GB

**How many GB is a 2 hour 4K movie?**

Below are rough estimates, and the actual file size can be more or less depending on the specific video content and compression settings used.

Low bit rate (e.g., 20 Mbps): Approximately 180 GB to 220 GB  
Medium bit rate (e.g., 50 Mbps): Approximately 450 GB to 550 GB  
High bit rate (e.g., 100 Mbps): Approximately 900 GB to 1100 GB (1.1 TB)

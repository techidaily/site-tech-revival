For example, you may get an error message saying "This is not a movie file" when you play a file with the extension .mpg, the QuickTime player crashes or you have some problem with the audio for any .mpg files on your Macbook Pro. So converting MPG to MOV video format is a must have in order to have a smooth .mpg playback on QT.

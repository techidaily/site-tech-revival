 Samsung took to the streets of Paris today to announce its latest lineup of foldables, wearables, and earbuds at its Galaxy Unpacked 2024 event. I got an early sneak peek at the [Galaxy Ring](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/essential-knowledge-how-io-screen-recorder-works/), [Z Fold 6](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-vsf-video-capture-insights-a-critical-look-for-2024/), [Z Flip 6](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/no-cash-all-fun-turning-twitter-vids-into-gifs-for-2024/), [Watch 7](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-pause-life360-location-sharing-for-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [Watch Ultra](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-reversing-tiktok-videos-tips-and-tricks/), and [Buds 3/Pro](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-silent-microphones-a-step-by-step-guide-to-restoring-voice-chat-in-discord/), and while I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this year's upgrade, I walked away thoroughly impressed.

##  Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6: A Fully Polished Design

Close 

 Now, in its sixth generation, Samsung has really started to refine and polish the foldable form factor. This year, the company was able to drop the Z Fold 6's weight down to 239g (only 6g heavier than the S24 Ultra), make the cover and inside displays shorter and wider, and flatten out the frame. Combined, the Fold 6 no longer feels like an awkward combination of a smartphone and a tablet.

 While the handset no longer feels like an overly narrow candy bar when folded close, the real magic comes to life when it's unfolded. At 5.6mm thick, the phone is only .5mm thicker than [Apple's new M4 iPad Pros](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-oneplus-ace-2v-face-lock-by-drfone-android/). This difference is so minute that I had the same feeling of disbelief seeing how thin the device was.

 The hinge system has also been improved with more durable materials and an official solid particle protection rating. Last year's Fold 5 was IPX8, but the Fold 6 is IP48\. This means the device is safe from items greater than 1mm. It's not quite as impressive as the IP68 (dust-resistant) rating found on most Samsung phones, but it's a starting point.

 Of course, we're still dealing with ultra-thin glass on the internal display covered by a manufacturer-installed screen protector. If you look hard enough, you'll see the seam before it gets to the frame, but it's barely noticeable in use. The same goes for the crease. You'll feel the small divot if you move your finger from one side of the screen to the other, but you'll hardly notice it unless you're looking at the foldable from a wide angle.

 In addition to the suite of Galaxy AI features first introduced with the S24 series, Samsung is also bringing Google's Gemini app and Circle to Search to these foldables. Everything from Interpreter and Live Translate to Note Assist and Sketch to Image will work on this device.

Close 

 The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also received a bit of polish with flatter and more squared-off edges. When I tell you how amazing this change is, it doesn't even begin to explain how great the phone feels to hold and fold open. And, of course, the Flip gets most of the AI features also available on the Fold 6.

 The best year-over-year upgrade will likely be the improved primary cameras. These rear-facing sensors have always dragged down previous Flips, so we should hopefully see better results with the introduction of a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide. There's also a slightly larger 4,000mAh battery, which is identical to what's found in the regular Galaxy S24\. Combined, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 should be a better all-around phone.

 The Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899.99 and is available with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage. You have your choice of Silver Shadow, Pink, and Navy. If I were to buy the phone, I'd choose Navy every day of the week. The Z Flip 6 is slightly cheaper, starting at $1,099.99\. You can pick it up in Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue, and Mint. In this case, the last option is the color I'd choose. I'd argue that Samsung's Mint looks even better than the [Google Pixel 8a](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-content-creation-evolution-studio-vs-innovative-beta/).

#####  Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6  
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone. It features a large, flexible internal screen that automatically picks up where you left off on the cover display. It is the definition of mobile productivity and entertainment with advanced multitasking capabilities, powerful performance, and enhanced Galaxy AI capabilities.

##  Galaxy Ring: A Subscription-Free Smart Ring

Close 

 Samsung first [teased the Galaxy Ring in January](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-youtube-marketing-key-methods-for-attracting-viewers/) at the company’s Unpacked event alongside the [Galaxy S24 series](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/decoding-xbox-connectivity-issues-server-malfunction-vs-individual-network-troubles/). We then saw the wearable again at MWC in Barcelona, but it was protected by a pane of glass. Half a year later, you can finally get your hands on the practically invisible activity tracker.

 The Galaxy Ring features everything you might want from a wearable, especially if you've been eyeing the [Oura Ring](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-videos-from-f5-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/). This includes sleep tracking, heart and respiratory rate monitoring, cycle tracking, workout detection, and more—all without a monthly subscription! Plus, it features 10ATM water resistance and has a grade 5 titanium finish, so you shouldn't worry about damaging the ring whether you're swimming or exploring the outdoors.

[![Oura Ring held in a hand](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/oura-ring-held-in-a-hand.jpg)](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-fix-for-coredll-absent-mistake-on-your-computer/) Related

##### [Here's Everything I Wish I Knew About Smart Rings Before Getting One](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-nubia-red-magic-8s-pro-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) 

If you’re over smartwatches, but want sleep and fitness tracking a smart ring may be your best bet.

[](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-the-unique-characteristics-of-public-private-and-personal-ai-systems/) 

 With my short time with the accessory, there isn’t too much I can tell you about the Galaxy Ring. It’s pretty lightweight coming in between 2.3 and 3 grams, has plenty of size options (5-13), and looks like…a ring. Something to note is that the gold model's reflective finish easily picks up fingerprints.

 But most of the magic will happen when you wear the device during workouts and while you sleep.

 Samsung tells me that you only need to wear the device for a complete cycle (a single day, including while you're asleep) to start getting insights into your health and stress levels and generating an "Energy Score." Of course, the more you wear it, the more insightful that data will be.

 Additionally, if you're wearing the Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch at the same time, the two devices will work together with your Samsung phone to detect which sensors more reliably track your metrics. Theoretically, your Ring might measure your heart rate while your Watch counts steps.

 I did get to see a demo of the Ring’s double-tap gesture, and it appeared to work well. At launch, double-taping your fingers together can be used to take a photo and dismiss an alarm on Galaxy smartphones. It would be amazing if third-party apps could incorporate the functionality; imagine progressing to the next page while reading a book in the Kindle app!

 Samsung recommended that I try to wear the Galaxy Ring on my index finger, but only because it's easier to achieve the double-tap gesture. According to a representative I talked to, you shouldn't experience better health metrics if you choose to wear the device on an alternative finger, such as your middle or ring finger.

 The Galaxy Ring is available in Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold and costs $399.99\. You can pre-order it starting today, and orders will ship on July 24\. If you don't know your ring size, you can get a sizing kit from Samsung for $10\. That $10 will go towards the cost of the wearable once you're ready to order a ring.

##  Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra: Beauty and the Beast

Close 

 The Galaxy Watch 7 is the one device that didn't see much of an upgrade year-over-year. If you've seen or used a Galaxy Watch from the last couple of years, you'll already be familiar with this design. The only changes are under the hood.

 Powering the Watch 7 series is the Exynos W1000 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. They run Wear OS 5 with One UI 6, include all of the usual sensors, and have a piece of sapphire crystal covering the 432x432 (40mm) or 480x480 (44mm) Super AMOLED display.

Close 

 If you're super active or just want a chonky smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung's answer to rugged Garmins and the Apple Watch Ultra. It has the same display resolution and internal specs as the Watch 7, but its durability is through the roof. We're talking 10ATM plus IP68 and MIL-STD-810H ratings which means you can scuba dive, navigate high altitudes, and work out in extreme temperatures without issue.

 Wearing the Watch Ultra feels incredibly different than testing out the Watch 7\. Instead of being sleek and slender, you get a 47mm display wrapped in metal and 12.1mm thick. It's also almost double the weight at 60.5g. If you're already wearing a rugged watch, this won't feel foreign, but it's definitely different from the rest of Samsung's lineup.

 The best thing about the Watch Ultra is Samsung's new proprietary watchband connector. Unlike Apple's and Google's systems, where you slide out the accessory, the Watch Ultra's band plugs directly in and pulls straight out (when you press down on the release button). This process is a million times easier to work with than the Galaxy Watch 7's, which uses universal spring bars.

 The Galaxy Watch 7 starts at $299.99 for the 40mm model and is available in Green and Cream. The 44mm option is slightly more premium in cost and comes in Green and Silver.

 If you prefer the rugged build, you can choose the Watch Ultra but know that it retails for significantly more at $649.99\. It's available in Titanium Silver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium White. The latter of the three was my favorite. The color absolutely popped in contrast with the AMOLED display.

##  Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro: Samsung Changed Up the Design

![Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 sitting on a table outside their charging cases](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-sitting-on-a-table-outside-their-charging-cases.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Samsung is moving away from its bean-shaped earbuds and is embracing the more “traditional” stem design. This means the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro look more like Apple AirPods than not.

 The ear tip is the most noticeable difference between the two sets of earbuds. The Buds 3 Pro features a silicone tip, which should allow for a more immersive listening experience. The standard Buds 3 have an open shape. Both models include ANC, but the Pros have better drivers (10.5mm dynamic and 6.1mm planar vs. 11mm dynamic), feature listening options like ambient sound and voice detect, and have a better battery life.

 Unfortunately, I didn’t get to listen to either of the Buds 3 earbuds, but they do support Bluetooth 5.4, as well as SSC HiFi, SSC UHQ, AAC, and SBC codecs. We'll need to test these out thoroughly, but I imagine they'll sound competitive.

 The best part about the redesign is the introduction of swipe and squeeze controls on the stems. Like with AirPods Pro, you can swipe up and down to raise and lower the volume and squeeze to adjust playback. I find these controls much easier to use than tapping on an earbud.

![Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 sitting on a table inside its charging case](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-sitting-on-a-table-inside-its-charging-case.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Also, this is a small detail, but I absolutely love that both cases are flat on the bottom. Standing up the case so you can see into the transparent lid is a nice touch, especially with the Pros which include "Blade Lights" to indicate their status.

 The Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are available in Silver and White. The base model costs $179.99, and the Pros cost $249.99.

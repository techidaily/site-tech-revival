* **[Disable startup programs on Windows 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Disable atartup programs on Windows 8 &10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 3: Free up your disk space

 Over time, your laptop accumulates files and programs, leaving you insufficient disk space to perform regular tasks. Eventually, this will slow down your laptop.

 To see if that’s the core issue, try running**Disk Cleanup** on your laptop to free up your disk space. Follow the instructions below to see how to do it:

**What is Disk Cleanup?**
 Disk Cleanup is a Microsoft built-in utility that allows you to get rid of the temporary and unnecessary files on your laptop.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**disk cleanup** .

### Method 7: Update drivers for your devices

 One of the most common causes of the performance lag on your laptop is outdated or faulty device drivers. It’s essential that you have the latest correct drivers for your hardware devices. There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your devices: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update drivers manually by going to the manufacturer website for each of your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the**Update button** next to the driver you want to update to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

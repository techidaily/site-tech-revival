## Boost Your Video Quality with the Opal Tadpole Webcam - The Perfect Enhancement for Subpar Laptop Cameras

### Key Takeaways

* The Tadpole is a lightweight, portable webcam with excellent video quality.
* Unfortunately, the tap-to-mute USB-C button doesn't appear to work with every video application.
* Consider price and connectivity needs before investing in this high-quality webcam.

 The [Opal Tadpole](https://www.amazon.com/Opal-Tadpole-Laptops-Directional-Microphones/dp/B0CM8V52PG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002138&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fopal-tadpole-webcam-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a bite-sized external webcam with a silicone clip-on attachment. It clamps (and unclamps) to laptops in seconds, and the integrated USB-C cable makes for fast plug-and-play operation. Paying to add a new webcam to a laptop that probably already has one isn't ideal, but this one is worth consideration if you need to go down that road.

##  Design: A True Tadpole

![The Opal Tadpole Webcam and its box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/jerome-thomas-how-to-geek-jerome-thomas-makeuseof-jerome-thomas-game-rant-jerome-thomas-android-police-jerome-thomas-xda-developers-jerome-thomas-pocket-lint-jerome-thomas-pocket-now_53512929113_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 I love the design of the Opal Tadpole. ‘Portability’ and ‘space-saving’ seem to have been key considerations on Opal’s part, and the fact that this [webcam](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-fix-re-emerge-missing-watch-icon-2023/) can be tucked away in a sleeve or backpack in a second is a huge win. Measuring 1.37 inches wide, 1.77 inches from top to bottom, 0.79 inches from front to back, and weighing only 0.31 pounds, the Tadpole is very lightweight and unobtrusive.

 One of my favorite parts of the design is the integrated [USB-C lead](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/). The nylon-braided cable keeps the wire safe from bends and tears, while the yellow cable pass-through lets you choose how much slack the USB-C lends. You can also use the pass-through to create a loop that you can conveniently close around your wrist or an attachment point on a bag or laptop case.

 Available in white or black, the front of the webcam is mostly taken up by the Tadpole’s lens. Out of the box, a silicone cover will be placed on the glass, which is easily removable. There’s also a notch for the Tadpole’s microphone and an LED indicator. The back of the webcam (where the USB-C lead terminates) is textured anodized aluminum.

 The clipping mechanism is all-silicone and opens up easily. While not ideal for desktop monitors, you’ll be able to clip the Tadpole onto just about any laptop you can think of—it fit on the top bezel of my late 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you’re going to be traveling a lot with your Tadpole, it may be worth investing in Opal’s carrying case too.

##  Setup: There is None

 I’m a huge fan of true plug-and-play setups, and the Opal Tadpole has next to no installation process. All you have to do is connect the USB-C lead to your laptop, enable a few camera permissions, and you’re good to go on Mac or Windows.

 I do wish that Opal would have thought of including a USB-A adapter. Chances are if you’re buying the Tadpole to replace your existing laptop’s so-so webcam, the computer might be on the older side—limiting your connections to standard USB. Not to mention the Tadpole’s USB-C is only a USB 2.0 connector.

##  Video Quality: A Cinematic Webcam

![The Opal Tadpole Webcam mounted to a laptop](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/jerome-thomas-how-to-geek-jerome-thomas-makeuseof-jerome-thomas-game-rant-jerome-thomas-android-police-jerome-thomas-xda-developers-jerome-thomas-pocket-lint-jerome-thomas-pocket-now_53513077564_o.jpg)

 The Opal Tadpole is equipped with a 48MP Sony IMX582 Exmor RS image sensor. The video and general image quality on the Opal Tadpole is _cinematic_. That’s big praise to throw at a webcam that isn’t much bigger than a Cheez-It, but it’s true! Overall colors and contrast were sharp, detailed, and lifelike. Skin tones were pretty spot on, and the Tadpole was pleasantly reactive to ambient lighting too.

![Image quality of the Apple Tadpole Webcam](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/opal-tadpole-webcam-image-quality-1.png) 

 When you’re sitting front and center, the camera does a nice job of blurring your background to keep the focus on you. But whenever I shifted a little, the lens would adjust lighting and focus to properly highlight my new position.

 The Tadpole’s 48MP sensor is only able to deliver 1080p at 30fps. That being said, if you’re using an older laptop with a low-quality webcam, or simply want a nice (but kind of expensive) upgrade to your computer’s existing video quality, you should definitely consider the Tadpole.

##  Sound Quality: A Decent Deliverable

 One of the Opal Tadpole’s big talking points is the webcam’s trademarked VisiMic system. The idea is that the webcam will only capture audio for whatever the camera can see, using zero noise-canceling tech.

 During a FaceTime test call, my girlfriend reported crisp and clear vocal quality on my end. The Tadpole also did an okay job at filtering out the background music I threw on for the FaceTime demo. Considering there’s no ANC-powered far-field array, my girlfriend could still hear the music, but at a reduced volume.

 Another convenient audio feature is the Tadpole’s tap-to-mute USB-C. With the camera connected, simply tapping the head of the USB-C cable will mute and unmute the mic during calls (a red LED illuminates when the mic is disabled).

 Unfortunately, your mileage will vary with this feature, as I’ve read reports of it acting iffy with certain video-conferencing platforms. On my end, I actually couldn’t get the tap-to-mute function to work with FaceTime at all.

##  Using Opal’s Desktop Composer: A Solid Add-On

 The [Opal Composer](https://opalcamera.com/opal-composer/download) editing suite is a macOS exclusive. Think of it as a ‘lite’ version of Adobe Photoshop, the macOS Photos app, and other image-editing programs.

 Most of your editing tools are located to the right of your Tadpole’s live view. These include adjusters for things like bokeh, zoom, lighting, color, as well as options for adding effects, stickers, and backgrounds.

 You can also use Opal Composer to record video from either the camera, your computer screen, or both. Other settings include adjustments for resolution, frame rate, the ability to download and install software updates for your Tadpole, and more.

![The Opal Composer desktop app for macOS](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/opal-composer-desktop-app-1.png) 

 It’s certainly not the most robust companion software out there, but it gives you a few handy customization tools to fine-tune your webcam experience.

##  Should You Buy the Opal Tadpole Webcam?

 The [Opal Tadpole](https://www.amazon.com/Opal-Tadpole-Laptops-Directional-Microphones/dp/B0CM8V52PG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002138&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fopal-tadpole-webcam-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a solid webcam for sure. It doesn’t skimp on video quality, and the VisiMic tech does a pretty decent job at honing in on the subject’s speaking voice. It’s also incredibly small, lightweight, and simple to clamp and un-clamp from your laptop.

 But is it a necessary addition to your laptop? If you're experiencing lackluster video quality from your computer's built-in webcam, or an older external webcam, I think investing in the Tadpole makes a lot of sense.

## Why YouTube Recommends H264 Codec Not HEVC?

YouTube indeed supports HEVC x265 video uploading, but on official Google Support site we find that YouTube recommends **H264** as the best video codec. Why? Does H265 have disadvantages when it comes to [compare H265 with H264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)? As a matter of fact, HEVC (H265) is already finalized, but it's not an all-pervading presence so far. Why is H265/HEVC not so popular as H264? Reasons are below:

 **1\.**  HEVC (H265) codec is patented by a good number of parties and charged in higher licensing fees. So many platforms don't accept HEVC codec now.   
**2\.**  HEVC indeed produces better video quality at lower space and bandwidth consumption. But it is much higher demanding than H264 in computing power, almost 10X more power needed. Compared with H264, HEVC has far higher requirements on hardware configurations (CPU, GPU & RAM), software (HEVC x265 player) and operating system (Win 10/macOS High Sierra/iOS 11/latest Android OS) to decode and play HEVC video.

To sum up, the   **compatibility of HEVC** needs to be improved. Currently the number of YouTube viewers whose hardware and software both support H265 HEVC video playback is quite limited. If you post HEVC video clips to YouTube, there is high likelihood that a large number of YouTube fans **can't successfully watch your HEVC YouTube video** because of their unqualified hardware configurations, software or OS. If your video is unaccessible to YouTube users, what's the point of putinging hevc to YouTube?

So to make your HEVC video be viewed by as many as YouTube fans, you're strongly suggested by the YouTubers who are thriving to [convert H265 to H264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and then post H264 video to YouTube. Thus, almost anyone can enjoy your YouTube video online or offline on any iPhone iPad Android or computer without any annoying requirements on your hardware device or software ([HEVC player](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)).

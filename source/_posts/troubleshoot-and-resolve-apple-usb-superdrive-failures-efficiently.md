## Quick Fixes to Mac SuperDrive Not Working Issues

To solve various iMac/MacBook SuperDrive not working issues, Apple also gives out some quick and effective ways. Before you get started with more complicated solutions, make sure you have checked the following tips: 

1. Ensure your Apple USB SuperDrive is **lying flat** on a surface with the silver top facing upward and don't put Apple external CD drive underneath anything heavy. Note that he Apple USB SuperDrive and MacBook Air SuperDrive are designed especially for use with Mac computers that do not have a built-in optical drive.
2. **Confirm your discs** will work with your computer. The non-standard sized or shaped disc will damage the external SuperDrive Mac and Apple USB SuperDrive. The SuperDrive only works with standard 120 mm round discs.
3. Be sure your **disc is flat**, make sure the drive is not interfered by disc labels and reset the SMC when your SuperDrive doesn't accept discs.
4. Make sure DVD is **not scratched or dirt** when SuperDrive accepts discs but they don't mount or are automatically ejected.
5. Check the disc whether it has a **label or other material stuck** to the disc and insert or eject a single disc several times when SuperDrive eject disc slowly.
6. **Don't use a USB hub** to connect a USB Superdrive to the Mac. The Apple USB SuperDrive and MacBook Air SuperDrive are designed exclusively for use with Macs and can directly connect to Mac's USB port. Connecting it to a USB hub can result in Mac Superdrive not recognized or showing up errors.
7. **Don't put** the Superdrive underneath or on the top of anything, such as your Mac.
8. If you use the Apple Superdrive with a Windows PC and get the Superdrive not working errors, **restart** the computer with the Superdrive plugged in.
9. Try to insert and eject a disc several times to correct the issue of noisy or vibrating drive.
10. Try **another USB port** if you're using an external Superdrive. Some USB port on your Mac may not provide enough power and that result in SuperDrive not working issues.
11. Make sure that the external SuperDrive is connected firmly to a Mac. Check out if there is any damage to the cable.

But I want to be able to see the drive on Finder and look at the files in the DVD. 

**A.** First of all, you should know that the SuperDrive won't show up in the Finder window or on the desktop UNTIL YOU PUT A DISC IN IT.

**Q.** When trying to connect a Superdrive (CD player) to my new MacBook that only has USB-C, I get an error message stating USB Accessory Needs Power, Connect "Apple USB SuperDrive" to a USB port on this Mac.

Don't use a USB hub." while there is no USB port on my Mac! How to get the Superdrive work on my Mac?

**A.** A USB SuperDrive won't work with USB-C adapter and any kind of hub as it doesn't offer enough power. You need to use some sort of passive USB-C to USB-A adapter from Apple or Apple-approved multiport adapters.

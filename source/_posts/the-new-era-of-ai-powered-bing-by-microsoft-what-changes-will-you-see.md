 Bing is a search engine featuring an AI chat function and an AI Image Creator. Thanks to a partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft was the first company to integrate DALL-E 3 into its products. This means you can use DALL-E 3 for free using either of the features mentioned.

1. Head to[Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) or the[Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create) to start generating images.
2. Enter your question or prompt into the text box, then press enter on the keyboard. It will generate four image variations that you can choose from.
3. If you're using Bing Chat, you can keep refining the image with follow-up questions. You don't need to restate your initial request either. Try a follow-up request like, "Can you redo the first image, this time using a more colorful palette?"
4. To save an image, click on the one you like and press the**Download** button beneath the prompt.

 There are plenty more[alternatives to DALL-E 3](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) worth checking out, too. Compare them to see which image creator works best for you.

## What Makes DALL-E 3 Special?

 DALL-E 3 promises to be a step up from its previous versions with improved accuracy, better photorealism capabilities, and more creative images. We've noticed a step up in quality as well, even when our prompts contain very few details.

 But the most notable change about DALL-E 3 is that it has been integrated into ChatGPT, OpenAI's powerful AI chatbot. It opens up a whole new way of interacting with the image generator and gives you a fresh way of creating prompts.

## How to Craft a Good DALLE-3 Prompt Using Bing

 DALL-E 3 is much easier to use thanks to its integration with GPT-4, the large language model that powers ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing.

 Even when you type a vague description, your chances of generating an interesting image are still high. This is because DALL-E 3 interprets what you write and creates a prompt for you behind the scenes. What makes the system even more fun to use is the ability to keep adding more requests without having to restate the original description each time. This is quite a significant shift in how you can use DALL-E.

 This is how it would pan out if we were[using the previous version of DALL-E](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/) . We gave DALL-E 2 the following prompt: "What would New York City look like in 2100 if plants had taken over?"

![DALL-E 2 image of NYC and plants](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dall-e-2-image-of-nyc-and-plants.jpg)

 When we asked if it could add animals to that image it just generated, it couldn't. Instead, it generated new images of just animals.

 Compare that with DALL-E 3 in Bing. The image it generated is quite good, considering our prompt barely contained any specific details.

 We followed this up by asking if it could add animals to the image it just created. Unlike DALL-E 2, it had no trouble understanding our request.

 You can even ask Bing to redo one of the images. We told it that we liked the second image and would like to see if it could make the animals more detailed.

 With just a small amount of time chatting with DALLE-3 in Bing, we arrived at a really interesting image of New York City if it were overrun by plants and animals. No prompt engineering is required.

## Limitations of DALL-E 3 and Bing

 With no subscription fees or waitlist, you're probably wondering what the catch is.

 If you're[using Bing Image Creator to create AI images](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-bing-image-creator-free/) , you are limited to 25 free "boost credits" that replenish each week. Boosts are used to generate an image within a timely manner—roughly 30 seconds—and when you run out, this can increase to 5 minutes.

 Given that DALL-E 2 is no longer available for free, it's a small restriction in return for using DALL-E 3\. Plus, if you use Bing Chat, you won't be required to sign up.

 Another change to DALL-E 3 is the increase in moderation and safety measures that some people might consider a limitation, such as "removing public figure names" from the prompt, as mentioned in the[DALL-E 3 research paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/DALL%5FE%5F3%5FSystem%5FCard.pdf) .

 But this will be a welcome addition for artists who don't want their images to train DALL-E in the first place. Adding to this, you can now fill in the[OpenAI opt-out form](https://share.hsforms.com/1%5FOuT5tfFSpic89PqN6r1CQ4sk30) to make sure your image doesn't go into the training pool.

## Don't Wait to Try DALL-E 3; Access It Now With Bing

 Head to Bing Chat to try DALL-E 3 for free. Each week, you get free boost credits that make it quick to generate an image. On top of that, you don't need to worry about engineering a prompt any longer, as DALL-E 3 can transform even the most vague request into an interesting AI-generated image.

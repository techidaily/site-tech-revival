## Revolutionizing Productivity: How Window Tiling Feature Overcomes Major Challenges on macOS Sequoia

### Key Takeaways

* Aero Snap changed Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia will revamp window tiling to match, finally making Apple catch up.
* Third-party window managers are temporary fixes, not integrated like the feature will be in Sequoia. They're limited and less reliable in the long run.
* macOS Sequoia's new window management features are a potential game-changer, offering better layouts and shortcuts for increased productivity.

 When I switched from Windows to macOS in 2019, one of my biggest issues was Apple's archaic window management system, but half a decade later the folks in Cupertino are finally getting with the program in the upcoming macOS Sequoia.

##  Aero Snap Revolutionized Windows

 All the way back in 2009 (!) Windows 7 was released to almost universal praise. Not since Windows XP did Microsoft have such a banger of an operating system, and people sure hung onto it until the very last minute they could!

 While there was a lot to like about Windows 7, one of the best features of the OS for me was "Aero Snap." This lets you quickly and easily arrange windows on your desktop by simply pushing a window to the left or right side of the screen. The first iteration of this feature was pretty basic, but today in Windows 11 [Snap Layouts](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-behind-the-mascara-youtubes-top-makeup-artists-unveiled/) are pretty much perfect in my opinion. Especially since I (like many of you) now use an enormous ultrawide screen for productivity, rather than a multi-monitor system. Manually arranging windows to make the most of this large modern screen would be a huge time-sink, so those layouts really help.

 Sadly, in macOS the best you can do is snap windows to the left and right of the screen, and it's not as intuitive. Instead of a gesture, you have to use an alternative function of the maximize button.

 I've lived with this for years, but I am annoyed by it every day. It's functional, but no fun to use and quite limited.

##  Third-Party Solutions are Less Than Ideal

 Of course, many of you will already be pointing out that you can use a third-party window manager such as [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) or [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/). These are fine apps and I'm grateful that someone stepped in while Apple was asleep at the wheel, but they were just band aids to the real issue. Installing these apps involves multiple steps of authorization and customization to features like keyboard shortcuts. They aren't tightly integrated at the OS level, and aren't as reliable as you'd expect something that's part of the actual OS to be.

 Plenty of people will prefer sticking with these third-party options, but I've never liked how they feel to use or how it's tacked on at a surface level. While it may seem like Apple has [Sherlocked](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/thumbnail-crafting-101-the-fundamentals-covered/) these apps, they'll probably pivot into doing something new and different compared to the new features in Sequoia.

##  MacOS Sequoia Is the Answer to My Window Management Prayers

 As you might imagine, I almost literally jumped for joy when Apple announced macOS Sequoia, which has a [revamped window tiling feature](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/revolutionize-traffic-flows-with-innovative-facebook-video-tactics-for-2024/) which looks to work pretty much like Microsoft Windows' solution. You can snap windows to the half or quarter position, and it even has a suggested layout feature which might be more intuitive than Wndows Snap Layouts, though that remains to be seen, of course.

 I already make extensive use of keyboard shortcuts on my Mac to rapidly switch between virtual desktops, and I often use my 12.9-inch iPad Pro as a second screen when using my MacBook away from my desk. Which is why I'm also excited to see a new set of keyboard shortcuts to manage windows and to cycle between different arrangements. As a writer, the less I have to take my fingers off the keyboard, the more work I can get done!

 Apple is often derided for taking years to bring features to its software that has been around elsewhere for years. Certainly, it's not clear to me why it's taken so long to build modern window management into macOS, but at this point, that's water under the bridge. As far as I'm concerned, macOS Sequoia can't come quickly enough.

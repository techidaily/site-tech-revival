## The Enduring Appeal of Ubuntu: Understanding Its Superiority Among Linux OSes

### Key Takeaways

* Ubuntu optimizes GNOME for different screen sizes, making it more user-friendly for all users.
* Access a vast software library with Ubuntu Store, PPAs, and Snaps for diverse application needs.
* Ubuntu offers reliable stability, routine updates, and long-term support options for professional use.

 Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution, and there is no denying that! However, being popular doesn’t necessarily mean being the best. So what are the reasons that make me think Ubuntu was and still is the best Linux distro of 2024?

##  The Best Linux Distro—What Does That Mean?

 The idea behind Linux distros is to offer an optimized pre-packaged experience for a specific workflow. Some distros are optimized for server work, some cater to gamers, others focus on breathing life back into outdated systems, and so on. As such, the best distro for Sam might not be the best for Daniel, and vice versa.

 So what makes a particular Linux distro objectively _The Best_? Well, my position is that if a distro performs well as an all-rounder and, with minor tweaking, can be optimized for different use cases, then it’s the best Linux distro. And here’s my argument on why I believe Ubuntu wins this title.

##  Ubuntu Makes GNOME More User-Friendly

 The GNOME desktop environment is celebrated for its unique, modern, and clean computing experience, which omits traditional desktop icons and app launchers in favor of dynamic virtual desktops for multitasking. This layout is particularly effective for enhancing productivity on smaller screens, such as 13'' to 15" laptops.

![The GNOME Desktop on Fedora 39](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-of-gnome-desktop-on-fedora-39-1.png) 

 However, this minimalism doesn't translate well on larger desktop monitors. For example, GNOME’s minimal interface can make 24'' or larger screens feel underutilized. Icons are more legible on a larger screen, so not having them doesn’t make sense. Also, the space saved from removing an app launcher is negligible (on the bigger screen) and rarely translates to getting more information on full-screen apps, like browsers or word processors.

 Ubuntu addresses this scalability issue by offering a heavily customized version of GNOME that adapts effectively across both small laptops and large desktop monitors. They reintroduce desktop icons, easing the transition for users coming from Windows or macOS environments. With direct access to icons on the desktop, important files and apps are just a click away, reducing the need to open a file manager frequently.

 Additionally, Ubuntu includes a unique vertically aligned app launcher or taskbar (aka Ubuntu Dock) on the [left side of the screen](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-flip-it-right-youtube-video-retrospectives-with-tips/). This placement takes advantage of the more expansive horizontal space available on modern monitors—maximizing vertical space for application use. The dock provides quick access to your favorite and currently running apps and can be set to auto-hide to free up screen real estate—beneficial for laptop users.

 As such, Ubuntu retains the modern and unique charm of GNOME all the while making it more accessible.

##  Access to a Ton of Software

 Ubuntu's popularity means that if a developer creates a Linux app, they're most likely targeting Ubuntu first. This gives you access to one of the largest software libraries in the Linux world.

 Installing applications is straightforward through Ubuntu Store, which offers a fully GUI-friendly experience similar to the Microsoft Store. Of course, traditional [APT commands](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-best-practices-in-winning-tv-recording-with-software/) are there for those who prefer installing apps using the terminal.

 That said, some niche applications may not be available in the main Ubuntu repositories. In such cases, you'll need to use [Personal Package Archives (PPAs)](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-future-of-home-safety-evaluating-the-battery-version-of-googles-wireless-nest-doorbell/) or download DEB files directly from developers and [install them using dpkg](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-contentment-a-practical-guide-to-daily-vlogging/) or GDebi.

 Third-party PPAs and DEB files are not verified by Ubuntu for security or stability. As such, only use these methods if you trust the source providing them. For example, you can trust the DEB file from Mozilla’s official website to install Firefox. But don’t download and install Firefox-NEO-ThisIsAmazing.deb from BroYouShouldTrustMe.com!

 Finally, discussing software availability on Ubuntu is [never complete without mentioning Snaps](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/rom-hobbies-to-hearts-youtubes-path-to-fame/)—a proprietary packaging format introduced by Canonical, the parent company of Ubuntu. Snaps are designed to be more secure and easier to manage but tend to be larger and consume more resources than traditional DEB files.

 In my books, Snaps can be a good choice if you’re using a modern system with an SSD and ample storage. Otherwise, stick to traditional DEB files (via APT) or explore [Flatpak as an alternative](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-marvelous-monitors-top-10-macbooks-with-4k-resolution/).

##  Stable and Reliable for Professional Use

 Ubuntu strikes a good balance between stability and innovation. It offers a reliable experience for your professional workflows, where you’ll rarely face bugs or hiccups. You’ll also get routine updates and bug fixes addressing known issues.

 Coming to updates, you can choose between an interim release or an LTS (Long Term Support) release. The interim releases come out every six months and get security updates and bug fixes for nine months. The LTS releases come out every two years and receive updates for five years, including hardware enablement updates to ensure compatibility with newer hardware.

 The new [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS version will be supported for 12 years till 2036](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-cultivating-the-culture-of-creativity-within-youtube-shorts-for-2024/) through an optional subscription called Ubuntu Pro.

 So if you want the latest tools and features as soon as possible, you can opt for the interim releases and upgrade every six months. Whereas, if you prefer stability and want to keep your exact setup running for as long as possible, you can pick the LTS releases.

 Moreover, Ubuntu never forces updates. You can delay them if necessary. Also, after an update, your computer won’t automatically restart. While some updates, like kernel updates, do require a restart, you get to choose when to do it.

 Ubuntu’s well-rounded experience catering to all types of users is why it is so popular and also why I crown it the best Linux distro of 2024\. If someone asked me what Linux distro to use, and I had no extra context, I’d recommend Ubuntu. However, if you have specific needs and unique workflows, then one of the many [Ubuntu alternatives](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-realme-c33-2023-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) might be ideal for you.

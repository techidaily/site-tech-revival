## MacOS, Ubuntu Users Welcome ProtonPass Integration: Expanding Secure Access Across Operating Systems

Proton, the company behind Proton Mail and Proton VPN, released a password manager last year and has been steadily adding new features. Now, Proton Pass is arriving on more platforms.

 Proton has released an official desktop application for [Proton Pass](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003508/https://proton.me/pass) on macOS and Linux, giving you easy access to your saved passwords from anywhere on your Linux PC or Mac. Proton Pass already had applications on Windows, Android, iPhone, and iPad, as well as a web app and browser extension.

 Proton said in a press release, “These two new applications extend the reach of Proton's secure password management by offering a fully integrated experience within the macOS and Linux operating systems. With this announcement, Proton Pass is now available on every platform – a feat achieved only a year after first announcing the product.”

 The macOS app is being released alongside a new Safari extension, which Proton says should simplify password management and auto-fill. There are also browser extensions available for Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and other Chromium-based browsers. You can still access all your saved passwords from the extension or web app, if you want to do that—the desktop app just saves you from opening your web browser first.

 Proton Pass has rolled out a few other helpful improvements over the past few months, including a built-in 2FA authenticator, [secure password sharing](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/toms-gadget-guide-in-depth-reviews-of-computing-technology-and-hardware-solutions/), [passkey support](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-breaking-down-how-to-find-your-latest-watched-fb-content/), and credit card support. It’s still missing a few features found in solutions like [1Password](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-up-and-running-install-epson-ds-530-printer-on-windows-10-using-official-x64-drivers/) and [Bitwarden](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-gopro-editors-blueprint-to-stunning-colored-images/), but it now has apps on all major platforms and covers all the basics. The free version is probably the best free password manager, though—Proton has been [pushing that point hard](https://mastodon.social/@protonprivacy/112564975021072092) as Dashlane prepares new limits on free accounts.

 There are more features in development for the desktop apps, too. The company said, “Proton Pass will soon support TouchID on macOS, allowing users to unlock their accounts using their fingerprints. Similarly, an upcoming update for Linux will integrate the app with the system’s authentication mechanisms and APIs. This will enable users to unlock Proton Pass using their Linux user account, fingerprint sensors, or any other method supported by PAM, enhancing both security and convenience. These features will be provided as an automatic update in the coming weeks.”

 You can [get Proton Pass](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003508/https://proton.me/pass) from the official website. There’s a free version, but unlocking all features requires a Proton Pass Plus plan, which is $23.88 per year (but the first year is $10 for a limited time). You can also get all the features through a Proton Unlimited plan, which also unlocks functionality in Proton Mail, Proton VPN, and other services.

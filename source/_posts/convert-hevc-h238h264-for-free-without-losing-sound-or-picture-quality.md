[H265 (HEVC)](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) offers almost twice higher compression ratio than H264 and applies less data to display an image without damaging its quality. In short, H265 is more efficient than H264\. That being the case, you guys still want to decode and **convert H265/HEVC to H264** (MPEG-4/AVC). Why? H265 poor compatibility should be the main reason. Majority of PCs, mobile devices, TVs, players and platforms work well with H264, while equivalent hardware or software for decoding HEVC (H265) is dramatically less common. So, to ensure a smooth H265 video playback on your devices, you'd better convert H265 to H264.

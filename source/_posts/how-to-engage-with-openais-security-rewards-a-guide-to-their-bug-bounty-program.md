## How to Join OpenAI's Bug Bounty Challenge – Everything You Need to Know

 If you're a security researcher, ethical hacker, or technology enthusiast, OpenAI is asking for your help. And it's not for free.

 On April 11, 2023, OpenAI announced a bug bounty program as part of its commitment to developing reliable, secure, and advanced AI systems, and anyone with the right skill set can potentially help out.

## What Is OpenAI's Bug Bounty Program?

[OpenAI announced](https://openai.com/blog/bug-bounty-program) its Bug Bounty Program to incentivize those using their applications, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, to create secure, advanced, and globally beneficial AI systems.

 Anyone who finds and reports vulnerabilities in OpenAI's systems will earn cash rewards, resulting in a win-win situation. While participants earn money, the company's systems become safer.

 OpenAI promises to protect you from liabilities or penalties if you follow its stated guidelines and will also acknowledge submissions and remedy validated vulnerabilities promptly. Furthermore, OpenAI claims it will publicly recognize your contribution if it is unique and leads to a configuration or code change.

 However, you cannot disclose your vulnerability-related findings to the public after submitting them.

 This[bug bounty program](https://www.makeuseof.com/bug-bounty-programs/) covers vulnerabilities in all OpenAI systems, including API targets and keys, ChatGPT, and the research organization. However, the initiative does not cover safety issues with OpenAI's model, including safety bypasses and getting the model to create malicious code. In addition, the firm will not be rewarding issues related to model prompt content or responses and[AI hallucinations](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/) . You may report these to[OpenAI's team](https://openai.com/form/model-behavior-feedback) for model behavior feedback.

## How Much Can You Earn From OpenAI's Bug Bounty Program?

 OpenAI determines the cash rewards to be paid based on how severe and impactful the discovered bug is. Typically, the reward ranges from $200 to $6,500 per vulnerability but can be higher if your findings are exceptional and of great consequence.

The maximum reward you can earn is $20,000.

 At first, the priority level of your finding, along with your reward, will be determined using[Bugcrowd's Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy](https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy) . However, if it deems it necessary, this level and your reward may be modified by OpenAI.

 Additionally, the AI research company will not reimburse you for any purchases or upgrades you make when identifying or testing for bugs.

## Which Vulnerabilities Are Eligible for Rewards?

 You will be rewarded for any security, functionality, performance, and documentation vulnerability you find in api.openai.com, third-party targets, ChatGPT, ChatGPT plugins, <https://openai.org>, \*/openai.org, OpenAI API keys, openai.com, \*/openai.com, and developer platform playground.

 These include server-side injection, server security misconfiguration,[cross-site scripting](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/crosssite-scripting-xss-security-threat/) (XSS), insecure OS/firmware, insecure data storage,[cross-site request forgery](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-csrf-attacks-and-how-can-you-prevent-them/) (CSRF), and broken authentication and session management.

 All the vulnerabilities must be in OpenAI's system, exploitable, and novel.

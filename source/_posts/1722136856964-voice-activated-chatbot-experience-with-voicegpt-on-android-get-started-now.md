 The app allows you to control ChatGPT via voice commands. Not only can you record your query with voice input, but you can also use it to perform a variety of tasks within the ChatGPT interface, even when you're on the go. Let's take a closer look at how you can set up and use VoiceGPT on your Android device.

## What Is VoiceGPT?

 VoiceGPT is a multi-functional app that helps you access and control ChatGPT through voice commands. It can perform a wide range of functions, such as text extraction, email writing, or image generation (via DALL-E integration). We'll take a closer look at some of its functionalities in the sections below.

 You can use the app hands-free by setting up hotword activation. Say something like "Hey, Chat" to pull up the app easily. There's also an option to switch from Google Assistant to VoiceGPT as the default voice assistant for your device, but do note that the feature can be rather laggy.

 Though the free version of the app might look a bit clumsy with all the ads, it is easy to use and is great for anyone looking to simplify their daily tasks. There are lots of settings you can use within the app to get it working just how you want it, and it's available in multiple languages.

 To get started, download the app and enable hotword activation for voice inputs. Ads support the free version of the app, however, you have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription for an ad-free experience.

**Download:** [VoiceGPT](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026716/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gpt.voice.chatgpt) (Free, subscription available)

In such case, you're suggested to change Netflix movies and TV shows to MP4 H264 (or MPEG-4) or MP4 H265 so as to smoothly playback on your handheld iPhone iPad Android. Now, the output video format and codec are decided, and what is undecided is the Netflix to MP4 transcoder. Here you can read on the below recommendations if you have no better choice.

##  Part 4\. FAQ about Netflix to MP4 Conversion

###  1\. Is it possible to convert Netflix movies to MP4 on Android?

Netflix does not allow converting downloaded content to MP4 on Android devices due to DRM restrictions. DRM is in place to safeguard content copyright and prevent unauthorized copying and distribution. The downloaded files from the Netflix app are encrypted and can solely be played within the app. They utilize a proprietary format tailored for playback within the Netflix app, making it difficult to convert them to MP4 or any other widely-used video format.

### 2\. What is an NFV file?

 An NFV file is a video file developed by the Netflix streaming app for Android and iOS offline watching once it gets downloaded within the Netflix app. And what you need to note is that it contains encrypted video for a movie or show. Thus, the so-called Netflix video converter on the SERP actually can't convert Netflix NFV file to MP4\. And removing DRM protects is a felony in most Western countries. So don't try to break MFV protection tech, even don't think about it.

### 3\. Is it illegal to screen record Netflix?

 No, You May Not. Recording anything (esp. the copyright protected content) from the online streaming services is strictly against the rules in most countries and areas. It depends on the specific area you're in for legal capture if the screen content you plan to record is unprotected by copyright encryption tech and is authorized by the streaming service owners for free personal watching. 

### 4\. How to transfer Netflix downloads to USB drive?

Run the Netflix application on your iPhone iPad or Android phone/tablet. Tap on the Menu icon in the upper-left side of the screen. Locate to App Settings on the drop-down list. Access to the Download Location option in the Downloads section. Select Download Location and tap on SD Card.

### 5\. How to convert Netflix to MP4 on Android?

It requires the Netflix app. If you don't have Netflix app, go to Google Play Store to download and install Netflix app on Android. Run Netflix app > tap "Download" tab > "Find Something to Download" to browse its downloadable videos. A "Download" button will appear on the right side of the video name > tap the button to start downloading Netflix video. You can free watch Netflix downloads in .nfv format from there offline. 

### 6\. How do I convert downloaded Netflix videoâ€™s nfv file format to MP4?

Converting downloaded Netflix videos in NFV format to MP4 is a complex task due to DRM protection. NFV files are encrypted and exclusively playable within the Netflix app.

To convert NFV files to MP4, one would need to circumvent DRM, which is both against the terms of service and illegal. Respecting copyright laws and adhering to streaming platform terms of service is crucial. If you desire offline viewing of Netflix content, it is recommended and lawful to utilize the official download feature within the Netflix app. This allows for downloading and viewing select movies and TV shows within the app itself, but the files cannot be converted to MP4 or any other format.

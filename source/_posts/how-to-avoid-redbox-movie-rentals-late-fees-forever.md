## Additional: Frequently Asked Question about Redbox DVD Rentals

### Q1: My Redbox rented DVD won't play, what should I do?

**A:** There's a couple of reasons why your [DVD won't play](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/dvd-wont-play-solved.htm
):   
1\. Is it possible that you're trying to play a Blu-ray Disc in a standard DVD player? Blu-ray Discs will only play in Blu-ray compatible players. You can tell if it's a Blu-ray Disc because the downward-facing side of it will be blue instead of silver, and it'll have a Blu-ray logo on top.  
2\. It might be dirty or smudged. If so, please take a soft, lint-free cloth, and wipe gently in a straight line from the center of the disc to the edge. Only clean discs with a solution of water and mild detergent or rubbing alcohol. Never use abrasives, solvents or highly acidic cleansers.  
3\. If you've tried to clean it and it still won't play, it might be scratched. You can try to [fix scratched DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with the DVD repairing tool. Or report your unplayable disc here and we'll help you out.

### Q2: How long is the Redbox DVD rental period?

**A:** Want to hold onto your disc for longer? No problem. For each day you keep a rental, you'll be charged for another rental period + applicable tax. If you hold onto your disc for the maximum rental period (almost everywhere, it's 17 days for movies and 23 days for games), you'll be charged the maximum charge and the disc is yours to keep.

### Q3: What happens if I return a movie or game after 9:00 p.m.?

**A:** You'll be charged for another rental day plus any applicable tax. If you only want to pay for one rental day, be sure to return your disc to any Redbox location before 9:00 p.m. the day after you rent it.

### Q4: Do I have to return my movie or video game to the same box I rented it from?

**A:** Nope. You can return your movie or video game to any box in the U.S. Use the Find a Redbox Location tool to find all the Redbox locations near you. You can also get the Redbox mobile app to find nearby locations when you're out and about.

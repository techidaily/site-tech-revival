##  Get Bing Photos as Your Desktop Wallpaper

 To get wallpapers from the Bing homepage each day, you'll need to download [the official Bing Wallpaper application](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-wallpaper) from Microsoft's website.

 Run the downloaded application to install it, and be sure to uncheck "Set Bing as my homepage" and "Set Bing as my default search provider" if you don't want to set Bing as your new homepage and default search engine in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

 The application will launch when you start your PC and automatically download and set a new desktop wallpaper image every day.

 To change your wallpaper, find the Bing icon in your [notification area (system tray)](https://www.howtogeek.com/75510/beginner-how-to-customize-and-tweak-your-system-tray-icons-in-windows-7/), click it, and use the arrows to quickly cycle through a few available wallpapers.

 You can also click this icon to see an explanation of what the photo is — for example, it will tell you what type of animal it is or where a landscape was photographed.

 People have used various third-party tools to set Bing images as desktop wallpapers for years — [even on Linux](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/mastering-light-and-shadow-with-iphone-xs-new-lens-technology/)! Now, finally, there's an official, supported, easy-to-use tool that does it for you on Windows 10.

 If you like the Bing Wallpaper tool, you can also get new images on your lock screen every day by leaving the included [Windows 10 Spotlight feature](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-plan-for-profit-from-instagram-content/) enabled. We've recommended [disabling Spotlight to get rid of advertising](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-creating-powerful-teacher-content-on-youtube-top-10-insights-for-2024/) in the past, but Microsoft hasn't used Windows Spotlight to push advertisements in quite a while.

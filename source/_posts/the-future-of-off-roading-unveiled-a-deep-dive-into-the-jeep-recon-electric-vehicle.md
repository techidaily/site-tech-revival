## The Future of Off-Roading Unveiled: A Deep Dive Into the Jeep Recon Electric Vehicle

Electric cars and trucks are quickly gaining popularity on roads, job sites, or in luxury garages, and now they're coming for your outdoor adventures. I'm talking about the all-new Jeep Recon 4xe, an electric SUV that could give the king-of-the-hill Wrangler a run for its money.

 Jeep has a storied history of making rugged and capable vehicles on and off the road, but will that legacy continue with the switch to electric motors? The Jeep nameplate is known for taking people off the beaten path, and its upcoming Recon EV is poised to continue that legacy. Here's what we know so far about Jeep's electric off-roader that's coming soon.

##  2025 Jeep Recon 4xe Release Date

Jeep

 The rugged new Jeep Recon 4xe was [unveiled at the end of 2022](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-awaken-the-warrior-within-with-these-10-films/), but parent company [Stellantis is being tight-lipped](http://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/jeep/press/jeep-brand-reveals-plan-for-global-leadership-in-suv-electrification) about what it'll offer or when. We know it takes cues from the Wrangler and has those famous removable doors, but the automaker has yet to get into the nitty-gritty details we all want.

 First, when will the electric Jeep Recon SUV hit the trails or streets? The latest comments from Jeep suggest reservations for the electric Recon 4xe will open later this year, with deliveries starting sometime in 2024\. As a result, it'll likely be listed as the 2025 Jeep Recon 4xe. We don't have a concrete date yet, but we expect to learn more early next year.

 Jeep has several all-electric vehicles on the way, from the Jeep Avenger in the UK to the luxurious Wagoneer S and Recon 4xe coming soon to the United States. Eventually, the entire US portfolio will go electric. In the meantime, you could consider the [Jeep Grand Cherokee Hybrid](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-sweet-indulgence-recording-a-compreran-analysis/).

##  Recon EV Price and Trim Levels

Jeep

 Like every Jeep model, from the Compass or Gladiator to the famous Wrangler, the new Jeep Recon will come in several trim variants. Until we get closer to pre-orders or an open reservation system, we don't know exactly what will be offered or how much it'll cost.

 However, looking at Jeep's recent hybrid and PHEV models, like the Wrangler 4xe, we have a good idea of what to expect. For example, the Sahara trim Wrangler 4xe is available for under $59,000, while you'll spend nearly $63,000 or more for the Rubicon 4xe. Considering the Recon is a slightly larger SUV with many similarities to the Wrangler, there's a good chance it'll have familiar trim levels and price points.

 The Jeep Recon 4xe will likely come in a base "Sport" package for $59,995, then go up from there. Some photos of the Moab trim [surfaced on a Jeep forum](https://www.jeepreconforum.com/forum/threads/first-real-life-look-2025-jeep-recon-moab-4xe-concept-shown-to-dealers-at-stellantis-event.10868/), and we're expecting a Jeep Recon Willys, Rubicon, and potentially others. Expect to pay upwards of $72,000 for the Jeep Recon 4xe Rubicon or Sahara.

##  Jeep Recon EV Specs and Performance

Jeep

 From the initial photos provided by Jeep, we can clearly see that the Recon is a boxy, rugged, mid-size SUV built for adventure. The front looks slightly like the GMC Hummer EV, with the slotted and illuminated grill and Jeep badging. Enthusiasts probably noticed the aggressive BFGoodrich all-terrain tires on all four wheels. Then, in typical Jeep fashion, a fifth full-size spare is mounted on the rear. And you can't forget about the roof rack, tow hooks, and what looks like a swing-out rear hatch door for easy access to all your camping gear.

 The initial press release talked about the iconic removable doors, a new "Selec-Terrain" traction management system, full 4x4 modes with electronic lockers, and a one-touch powered top. Then, select trims will get an optional panoramic sunroof.

 You're likely wondering about its estimated horsepower, torque, gear ratios, battery capacity, range, and off-road chops. Unfortunately, we don't know those yet. Jeep's first all-electric vehicle in the UK, the Avenger, packs a small 54-kWh battery and a single electric motor good for an estimated 249 to 342 miles per charge.

 With the Jeep Recon 4xe, we expect a battery closer to the 90 or 100-kWh range, if not bigger, using the newly developed ["STLA Large" electric platform](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/march/stellantis-announces-allocation-of-bev-centric-stla-large-vehicles-to-cassino-assembly-plant). Reports from [Autocar.uk](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-recon) suggest it'll offer nearly 600 horsepower, get over 370 miles of range, and go from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds. If those numbers are accurate, it'll give capable [off-road vehicles like the Rivian R1S](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/understanding-artificnial-intelligence-insights-and-potential-risks/) a run for their money.

##  Will the Recon EV Replace the Wrangler?

Jeep

 The Jeep Wrangler is an iconic and competent vehicle. One made even better with the introduction of the Wrangler 4xe hybrid. What makes the Recon so exciting is that it's taking inspiration from the Wrangler, not replacing it, and Stellantis wants the Recon to sit aside the Wrangler at the top of those rugged Moab off-road trails.

 The vehicles will complement each other and give buyers additional options. Being slightly larger than the Jeep Wrangler or Gladiator, thanks to a more traditional SUV form factor, the Recon is well-positioned. It may end up being an excellent option for Jeep fans who want something closer to a Grand Cherokee yet still want a rugged vehicle. Or, those that want a tough vehicle but prefer Jeep to something like the [powerful new Silverado EV](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-youtube-shorts-key-facts-for-2024/). However, whether an all-electric Jeep will have the same loyal following of users, vehicle modifications, lift kits, and accessories for off-roading or overlanders remains to be seen.

##  An EV for Adventure Seekers

 It's no secret that Jeep Wranglers aren't the most comfortable or quiet ride around town, with the solid front axle and often meaty tires. With the all-new Jeep Recon EV, Stellantis is likely positioning the vehicle for those who want a capable EV on and off the trails. It'll be a smooth and stylish SUV for the family, yet tough enough for adventure seekers to enjoy the great outdoors on the weekends.

 So, whether you're headed to work, taking the kids to school, or wandering up a trail to find the perfect camping spot, Jeep's Recon 4xe EV could be up for the challenge.

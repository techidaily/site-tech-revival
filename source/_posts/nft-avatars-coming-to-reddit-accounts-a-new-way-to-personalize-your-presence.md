## NFT Avatars Coming to Reddit Accounts - A New Way to Personalize Your Presence

Hot on the heels of Twitter adding NFT profile pictures, Reddit is looking to do the same. The website is currently testing the feature, so it could only be a matter of time until limited edition [NFTs](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/techniques-for-writing-eye-catching-podcast-summaries/) are all over Reddit.

 A Reddit spokesperson spoke to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/26/reddit-tests-allowing-users-to-set-any-nft-as-their-profile-picture-similar-to-twitter/) about the company's plans for the NFTs in the future. "We're always exploring ways to provide value for users and communities on Reddit. At the moment, we're testing the ability to use NFTs as profile pictures (avatars) and verify ownership," said Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt. "It's a small, internal test, and no decisions have been made about expanding or rolling out the capability."

 It sounds like this is the type of thing that might never make its way to Reddit, as the company is only in the early phases of testing. However, if it does choose to implement it, it gives those rare [NFTs another purpose](https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-echo-effects-implementing-reverb-in-digital-sound-environments-windows-edition/). After all, if you spent large sums of money on an image, you probably want to show it off in as many places as possible.

 This isn't Reddit's first jump into the NFT space. The company already offers its own CryptoSnoos at nft.Reddit.com (though they've long been sold out). As the company has already embraced selling its mascot in limited qualities, it only makes sense for it to get into NFT profile pictures.

 As far as what blockchains Reddit would support, the company didn't elaborate, so we'll have to wait until this feature becomes more widespread before we'll know more.

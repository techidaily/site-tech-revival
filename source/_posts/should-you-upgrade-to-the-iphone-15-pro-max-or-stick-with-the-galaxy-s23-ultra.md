### 2\. Hardware

Apple's A17 Bionic chip, built on the cutting-edge 3nm process, powers the iPhone 15 Pro Max. This hexa-core processor clocked at 3.46GHz delivers exceptional performance. Paired with Apple's custom GPU, it promises a smooth and responsive experience for any task. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is no slouch with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, fabricated on the 4nm process. Sporting an octa-core setup, including a high-performance Kryo Prime core clocked at 3.36GHz, it ensures snappy performance. Accompanied by the Adreno 740 GPU, graphics-intensive applications and gaming on the S23 Ultra are handled with finesse. 

Both devices pack 8GB of RAM, although the S23 Ultra incorporates LPDDR5X, enhancing memory efficiency. In the realm of internal storage, the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at 256GB with no expansion options, whereas the S23 Ultra matches this capacity with no expandability as well.

### 3\. Supported OS

When it comes to the operating system, the iPhone 15 Pro Max runs on iOS 17, offering Apple's signature ecosystem and regular software updates. On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra operates on Android 13, providing a customizable experience and access to the vast Android app library.

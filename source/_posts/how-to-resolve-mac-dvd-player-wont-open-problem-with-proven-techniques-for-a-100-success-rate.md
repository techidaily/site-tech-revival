_"Recently my MacBook Pro will read and play the DVD, but once it plays for a certain point, and I try to do anything (pause and then unpause, eject, close the app, go back to the main menu) the Mac DVD player stops responding. I either have to turn my computer completely off and restart, or close the MacBook, wait for it to go to sleep, open it up and then force quit."_

It's very frustrating when the DVD player is not responding on Mac and won't play a DVD. Occasionally, the DVD player freezes with a black screen and the computer gets stuck. "Mac DVD player not responding" may be one of the nastiest [Mac DVD player not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) errors because it just becomes unresponsive without giving a clue. In this post, we will show you how to bring the unresponsive Mac DVD player back to normal.

#### \[Possible Fixes\] You May Fix "DVD Player won't Respond" Error Below

**1\. Reset SMC and NVRAM/PRAM**

It may be improper settings that cause the DVD player won't respond/stuck & black screen errors. To fix, reset the SMC and NVRAM/PRAM (the steps may vary on different Mac models).   
 To reset the SMC: shut down the Mac > press and hold the power button for 10s and restart > press and hold the right Shift, the Optionand the left Control key for 7s > keep holding them and then press and hold the Power button for 7s > then release and wait for seconds > restart.   
 To reset the NVRAM/PRAM: shut down the Mac > press the Power button > before you see a grey screen, press the Command, Option, P and R keys simultaneously until you see a grey screen > keep holding them until the Mac restarts and you hear a second startup sound > release.

**2\. Adjust the DVD player preferences**

Corrupted preferences can also be the culprit for Mac DVD player not responding errors. Delete the DVD preference file can normally fix it:

Open the Finder and click Go button from the Finder menu bar > Go to Folder. Type or copy paste the following: \~/LIbrary/Preferences/com.apple.DVDPlayer.plist. Then delete the com.apple.DVDPlayer.plist file and restart your Mac and try again.

**3\. Try another DVD player**

After the above fixes, if still the DVD player is not responding on Mac, you can try another option than buying an external drive to work with the DVD player app - play the DVD with another DVD player.

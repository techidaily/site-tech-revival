As is known to all, there are many types of DAT files, for example, text-based DAT files, video DAT files, Email attachment DAT files and more. The text-based DAT files can be viewed in a text editor, but the video DAT file can't be played easily. Actually, DAT video file is MPEG1 or MPEG2 format with DAT extension and stored on VCD (Video CD). 

For now, DAT is only supported by VCD/DVD/Blu-ray player, Windows Media Player prior to version 9 and QuickTime with plug-in installed. Unfortunately, DAT video file is not compatible with other popular media players, video editing software or mobile devices like iTunes, iPhone iPad, Android, etc. Thus, to freely play DAT files anywhere anytime, you are suggested to convert DAT to MP4 video format.

## Part 3: Top Free Media Player for DAT to MP4 - VLC

[VLC video player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) might cause some minor errors for directly playing back DAT files (due to DAT container format not fully compatible with VLC). Yet, don't forget VLC media player also sports with video converting feature. And it supports MPEG-1, MPEG-2, WMV3, VC-1 and H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) hardware decoding using DxVA2 to accelerate video converting speed. As for DAT encoded mostly by MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, it's included in VLC hardware decoding codec. 

**Pros:**

**Optional: enable hardware decoding on VLC.**

Before you go, tap Preferences at the top menu of VLC > Input/Codecs > move to "hardware-accelerated decoding" and change Disable to DXVA 2.0 > tap "Save" button. Then go back to the main interface.

Choose MP4

**Step 4: Start to hardware decode DAT to MP4!**

Hit Start and VLC's conversion engine will go into action to convert a DAT to MP4 format. Since VLC only features hardware decoding, no hardware encoding, the encoding part will still rely on software encoding, slightly more heavy on CPU usage (compared with MacX's hardware encoding) and much slower on conversion speed. Certainly, maybe hardware encoding tech will come to VLC in the near future. Expect!

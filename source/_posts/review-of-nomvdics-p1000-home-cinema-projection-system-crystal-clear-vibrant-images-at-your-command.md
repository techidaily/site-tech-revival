## Review of Nomvdic's P1000 Home Cinema Projection System - Crystal Clear, Vibrant Images at Your Command!

### Key Takeaways

* The Nomvdic P1000 4K UHD Home Projector offers a bright and vivid image with a compact size and integrated handle.
* The projector performs well in both daytime and nighttime conditions.
* The built-in speakers provide great sound quality, eliminating the need for external speakers. Despite its price, it is a solid option for a big-screen experience.

 Now that massive TVs are relatively affordable, the draw of a projector is to create an even bigger image with a much smaller footprint. The [Nomvdic P1000 4K UHD Home Projector](https://www.amazon.com/NOMVDIC-Projector-Keystone-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B0C89MD2KF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001536&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnomvdic-p1000-4k-uhd-home-projector-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) does just that with up to a 180-inch 4K display in a compact and portable package. Best of all, it has a high enough brightness level to be used almost any time of the day.

##  A Square Design But Not Square Personality

![Hand holding the integrated handle of the Nomvdic P1000 4K projector](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/hand-holding-the-integrated-handle-of-the-nomvdic-p1000-4k-projector-2.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The Nomvdic P1000 4K UHD home projector is basically a cube. While it’s not as small as some of the projectors meant to be traveled with, it isn’t huge or cumbersome. At its tallest, it tops out at 8.27 inches. It even felt much lighter than its roughly 12-pound weight. It’s marketed as an indoor, home projector, but Nomvdic probably assumes it will at least be moved from room to room because of its included stealth handle on the top.

 I’m glad the handle is present because it would be awkward to lug around, even short distances. I did like how the handle fit snuggly into place magnetically, but it wasn’t always easy to unlatch one-handed.

 I also liked the select media controls along the top of the projector. Volume up and down and pause and play all made sense for the quick action things you’d want to do if the remote wasn’t within reach.

 There’s no lens cover, but again, it’s not really meant to be traveled with. Overall, the size and shape make it a perfect candidate to use for a basement, game room, or to move around the house as different sporting events occur.

##  Shows and Movies Look Great

![Ports on the Nomvdic P1000 4K projector](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/ports-on-the-nomvdic-p1000-4k-projector-2.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The crux of the Nomvdic P1000’s performance lies in its 4K UHD resolution and 2,300 ANSI lumens—brightness. Without enough brightness, you won’t be able to use it during the day and it will be relegated to after-dusk usage. It beats out plenty of competitors in this area and is probably the biggest reason to consider it.

 I had no problem using the projector during the day, but I still tried to avoid bright, direct sunlight. The picture could still get washed out on a sunny day with all the window shades open. However, it was still mostly visible. I’ve used outdoor portable projectors, and their 500 lumens just don’t cut it until nightfall or in completely blacked-out rooms. That wasn’t the case with the P1000, and this one blew those weaker ones out of the water.

 You’ll want to use a [projector screen](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-zte-nubia-flip-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) to get the best picture, but a plain white wall can still work fine.

 A lot of the shows and movies I watched on the projector were with Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max—essentially a free add-on in the box with the P1000\. Without connecting an external device like a streaming stick, computer, game console, or similar, there’s not much you can do with the P1000\. It will allow casting from a tablet or phone, but you will want to connect something to it.

 This particular streaming device is key for its 4K output, but also because it can be used without external power. The Fire TV stick can be plugged into the P1000’s USB-A port to power itself. I tried to use a [Google Chromecast with Google TV 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-GA01919-GA01919-US-Chromecast/dp/B08KRV7S22?linkCode=df0&hvadid=563725902662&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10309132737489004059&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031266&hvtargid=pla-1181618008684&mcid=4637675c3a763eb28ba9423357535737&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001536&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnomvdic-p1000-4k-uhd-home-projector-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) and it wouldn’t turn on without being plugged into higher wattage. The 4K Max stick warned that it needed more power but always functioned as intended.

 It’s less important that a streaming device be powered by the projector itself, in the house compared to outdoors, but it’s still handy to only need to plug the projector itself into power.

 All of the movies I watched were sharp and crisp. I watched some baseball clips and other sports and those performed perfectly fine on the projector as well. Colors were vivid and the picture the device projected was easy to watch. The sample images are blown up to the largest screen size on a wall and the two MLB Network ones were taken at night. The commercial image was taken earlier in the afternoon with more light present.

Close 

 The P1000 claims 4.2ms ultra-low latency at 240Hz for gaming. I didn’t get to put those specs to the test fully, but it handled my Nintendo Switch connected to it just fine.

 Another product highlight is its ±40 degrees of auto H/V [keystone correction](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-an-auto-subscription-url-for-your-channels-youtube-profile/), four corner adjustment, and autofocus. All of the automatic adjustments worked as expected and I never had to fiddle with the wealth of manual settings. However, if you like to tweak settings to death, you can do that.

 Projectors have fans, so this is not a unique complaint about the P1000, but I could definitely hear its fan noise when a movie was paused or nothing was playing. Under the cover of the better-than-expected integrated speakers, the fan noise was never a concern. This is mostly a note to first-time projector owners that the fan noise is normal.

##  The Sound Is Great

 Since the Nomvdic P1000 isn’t a large device, I wasn’t expecting much from the built-in speakers, despite them carrying the Harmon Kardon name. Maybe that’s why I was thoroughly impressed with the sound performance almost instantly—or maybe they just sounded good.

 Importantly, the speakers get loud enough to fill a living room without clipping or distorting. Of course, your mileage will vary slightly depending on what you’re watching. I would expect constant explosions to sound a bit worse than announcers calling a football game.

 I never needed to turn the volume up over 50% to get a big, full sound. When you do turn them up, they get quite loud. You can connect external speakers if you want to impress your guests even more, but I liked that the projector didn’t need to rely on additional speakers and could hold its own in the audio department.

##  Price and Availability

 The P1000 retails for $1,499, whether or not you want the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max included in the box. It does have a $200 off coupon on Amazon as of early January 2024 that brings its price down to $1,299.

 As a way to get a huge, 180-inch screen to watch a baseball or football game or a movie, I really liked how the [Nomvdic P1000 4K UHD Home Projector](https://www.amazon.com/NOMVDIC-Projector-Keystone-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B0C89MD2KF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001536&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnomvdic-p1000-4k-uhd-home-projector-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) performed. It was bright enough to be used at nearly any time of the day and included impressively loud built-in speakers.

 However, this product isn’t an impulse buy, the way some of the cheaper, portable projectors seem to be. It’s a fine value at full retail price compared to other options in the same brightness range. On sale, it’s a solid option for getting a big screen without dealing with the physical size of moving an 85-inch TV.

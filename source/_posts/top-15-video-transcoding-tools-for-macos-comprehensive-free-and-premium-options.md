### No.2: [Movavi Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/movavi/products/)

* Supported macOS: Mac OS 7/8/9 or higher
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.8/5 (G2)

**Best for:** People who need rapid and high-quality video conversion without compromising quality.

Movavi Video Converter is listed as the best video converter for Mac simply because it provides a pretty intuitive interface, through which you will know how to handle it as soon as you launch the app even you are a newbie. For novice users who are unknown of the obscure settings, the long list of preset profiles categorized in Popular, Video, Devices, Audio, Images, Custom is a good helper. That means you can directly convert the video file optimized for your device without the need to tweak the complicated parameters.

![Movavi Video Converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/movavi-video-converter.jpg)

The agile video conversion speed is also the top-selling point of this Mac video converter. You can have a try for its performance by taking advantage of the 7-day trial version for free, which, however, only allows you to convert half of each video using conversion acceleration. The constant reminders of purchasing the full license can be too much annoying if you don't have enough budget.

Movavi Video Converter is often reported to be stuck on Verifying, according to users. If you run into the error, please click the Apple icon on the top left of the desktop and select System preferences > Security & Privacy. Click the lock icon at the bottom of the General tab and enter your password. This will help solve the issue and then convert video on Mac freely.

**Pros:**

* Supports 180+ video file formats conversion on Mac.
* Fast video conversion speed thanks to Hardware Acceleration technology.
* Flexible video file size adjustment allows for compressing a video.
* Batch video conversion is allowed.

**Cons:**

* There is only 7-day trial version for free video conversion.
* The trial version adds a watermark on the output video.

**Price:** Movavi Video Converter offers 1-year and lifetime licenses for you priced at $54.95 and $64.95 respectively. 

### No.3: [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

* Supported macOS: macOS 10.13 and later
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.7/5 (G2)

**Best for:** Users who are looking for a totally free way to convert videos to MP4 on Mac quickly.

HandBrake is hailed as one of the most favored Mac free video converters to handle pretty much anything you throw at it and to repackage them into the most useful formats like MP4, MKV and WebM. Though the output formats are limited (only three), the presets are numerous, from general profiles Fast 1080p 30, Super HQ 1080p 30 Surround, web Vimeo YouTube HQ 1080p/720p 60 to device Apple 2160p60 4K HEVC Surround, Apple 1080p30 Surround. So, you can rest assured to use it to convert videos on Mac for any purpose like playback, uploading, and streaming.

![HandBrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake.jpg)

Its output video quality won't let you down. You can balance the video quality and file size to the best level by means of Constant Quality (RF value) or Avg Bitrate on HandBrake. Also there is a boon from this Mac video converter for conversion speed: its support for Apple VideoToolbox will hardware encode H264 & H265 video so as to accelerate converting speed as well as shift compute burdens from CPU to GPU. BTW, Apple VideoToolbox hardware encoders (H264 VideoToolbox or H265 VideoToolbox) automatically pops up under the encoder control on the Video tab for quick conversion if you're running on 2015 or later Macs.

All in all, HandBrake is a decent option if you don't mind its old-fashioned yet non-intuitive interface and limited output formats, alongside with lack in video editing features. It’s typically suitable for common video conversion on Mac like [MOV to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MKV to MP4, and the like.

**Pros:** 

* Provides a slew of customization options & diverse presets, including device-specific presets.
* Built-in settings to improve quality and conversion speed.
* Open-source and 100% free.
* Supports a wide array of codecs and formats.
* Compatible with Intel Macs and natively support Apple Silicon Macs.
* Comes with web optimizations, filters, subtitles, chaptering, etc. options.

**Cons:** 

* The interface is not overly intuitive at first glance.
* Being plagued by the issue of slow conversion speed.
* Basic video editing features are absent.
* Only hardware encoder is available for HandBrake macOS version, no hardware decoder.

**Price:** HandBrake is an open-source and free video transcoder that anyone can use to convert videos on Mac without a penny.

### No.4: [Wondershare UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

* Supported macOS: Mac OS 10.11-11
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.6/5 (Capterra)

**Best for:** Users who prefer products from big brand.

Wondershare UniConverter is a very versatile video converter for Mac that supports the Apple M1 processor. It's able to re-encode videos and DVDs to MOV, MP4, AVI, MP3, and other 1,000+ formats with high quality. No matter you want to download online video, record screen, burn DVD, or make GIFs, Wondershare UniConverter can cut the buck.

However, the free version has some limitations. First, the output video comes with the watermark or audio advertisement, and if you want to transcode video to audio format, like MP3, you will need to watch the ads first. There are limits on the output number or length of videos in other functions. However, you can upgrade to its premium version to get rid of the issues. 

![Wondershare UniConverter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/uniconverter.jpg) 

BTW, there is one thing to be notified, Wondershare recently updated its video converter to version 14\. For perpetual license users who purchased before May 1, 2022, they need to pay a certain amount for the upgrade to unlock more new features.

* User-friendly interface.

**Cons:** 

* Free version is limited in functions and paid one is expensive.

**Price:** The latest paid version of Wondershare video converter is UniConverter 14 which gives various paid plans. For individual users, $49.99/Year is needed.

### No.5: [VideoProc Converter](https://www.videoproc.com/video-converting-software/)

* Supported macOS: macOS Ventura and earlier
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.5/5 (Capterra)

**Best for:** Users who need an advanced tool to convert large and 4K/HD videos on Mac by utilizing Hardware Acceleration technology.

VideoProc Converter is a brand-new yet powerful video converter for Mac coming with a ton of features, including video conversion, compression, recording, and editing abilities.

![VideoProc Converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/rip-audio-from-youtube-videoproc.jpg)

* The free version has limitations, such as watermarks.

**Price:** VideoProc Converter offers three pricing plans to cater to different needs: $25.95 for a One-Year Subscription (3PCs/3Macs), $39.95 for Individual Lifetime Use (1PC/1Mac), and $57.95 for Family Lifetime Use (3-5PCs/3-5Macs).

### No.6: [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html)

* Supported macOS: Mac OS X 10.7.5 or later
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.5/5 (TechRadar)

**Best for:** Users who need both video playback and video conversion features on Mac for free.

VLC is born to be a free and open-source video player that works on different platforms including Mac. It's very popular for extensive support of almost all formats without the need to download extra codec packs. In fact, a reliable video file converter is also housed in this fully-fledged media player. You can use it to decode and encode video to H.264, H.265, MPEG4, MPEG2, WMV, Android, etc. on Mac for different purposes. It even allows you to convert non-encrypted DVDs to digital formats. 

![VLC Media Player](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc.jpg)

When using it as a Mac video converter, however, there are some limitations such as slow conversion speed, limited output formats and video resolution. So, if your video is quite large and high-quality, you'd better not use VLC to convert videos on Mac. If you only need to convert common videos to popular format MP4, it can perfectly satisfy your need without errors.

VLC media player requires Mac OS X 10.7.5 or later. If you are working with legacy releases of Mac OS X, please download the older releases accordingly. For example, for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, please download VLC 2.2.8 here: https://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.8/macosx/vlc-2.2.8.dmg, otherwise you can't play and convert videos on Mac successfully.

**Pros:** 

* Free and open source.
* Owns some advanced features such as basic editing.
* Directly plays the video after converting on Mac.
* Swiss Army Knife for video playback.
* Supports Apple Silicon Macs.

**Cons:** 

* Limited file formats support for basic video conversion on Mac.
* Editing metadata isn't straightforward.
* Choppy or crash when processing large and high-definition videos like 4K videos.

**Price:** VLC is also a free and open-source media player that will never ask for a fee for media playback or video conversion on Mac.

### No.7: [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)

* Supported macOS: macOS Catalina and earlier
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.4/5 (G2)

**Best for:** People who need video converting and editing features in one software.

Avidemux is a free and open-source software for non-linear video editing and transcoding multimedia files. It's also a simple and powerful video converter freeware for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can use it to convert videos on Mac from any formats into AVI, MPEG, TS, MKV, MP4, and FLV. Flexible video encoding options are built-in to let you adjust the video settings, audio parameters, encoding mode, and more. It is one of the best free Mac video converters for those who need a quick video converting, but not the ideal choice for 4K/HD video converting as it doesn't work well with the newer codecs like HEVC and AV1 in 4K videos.

![Avidemux](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/avidemux.jpg) 

The best part is it allows lossless editing by enabling the Video/Audio output copy. So, you can add filters, cut unwanted materials, cut down a clip, split several videos into segments, etc. without encoding. 

There are some users who reported Avidemux not working error after the macOS upgrade. For example, the program opens an empty screen when loading MKV or MP4 file, or results in a larger, distorted image. A solution to fix this is to either update the video converter to a newer version or try another video converter for Mac.

**Pros:** 

* Offers a wealth of editing features, incl. filters, advanced interlacing, cropping, splicing, etc.
* Open-source and free.

**Cons:** 

* No instructions.
* Slow video exporting process.

**Price:** Avidemux is a free and open-source software application for non-linear video editing and transcoding multimedia files that anyone use for free anytime.

Fast being the key word, Aimersoft Video Converter Ultimate gives 90X faster lossless conversion when converting videos on Mac. The inbuilt Lossless Conversion Technology lets you convert videos without decoding and encoding process so as to reserve the highest output quality. To prove the authenticity of its conversion speed, it has done a speed test in which Aimersoft wins over Wondershare, Movavi, Freemake and Any Video Converter. All videos including 1080p, 720p, and 480p files processed by Aimersoft is excellent in resulting quality. However, there is no 4K video example, so we can’t see its conversion performance when it process 4K HEVC/H.264 videos.

![Aimersoft Video Converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/aimersoft-video-converter.jpg)

### No.9: [Any Video Converter Mac](https://www.any-video-converter.com/products/mac%5Fvideo%5Fconverter%5Ffreeware/)

* Supported macOS: macOS X 10.7-10.15
* Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.0/5 (TechRadar)

**Best for:** People who want to convert videos on Mac for specific devices.

Any Video Converter, short for AVC, is one of the most useful and simple free video converter software working on both Mac and Windows. It supports standard video, HD video and Ultra HD 4K video. It's able to free convert videos on Mac to more than 13 video and 15 audio formats, e.g. [MKV to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), AVI to MOV, RM to FLV, AVI to WMV, etc. For those users who don't want any interaction in parameter settings, click the device icon and there are profiles for Apple, Android, game console, and 70+ other profiles. But the device profiles don't get constantly updated and there is no latest iPhone and Samsung models.

![Any Video Converter Mac](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/any-video-converter.jpg)

Besides a Mac video converter, you can even use it to free download online videos from websites including Facebook, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc. Then you can also customize your video before converting, add effect, adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, crop the black borders from the video, adjust image size, or add external subtitles to a video. Note that it lacks the ability to rotate, trim, adjust aspect ratio, etc. if you have such a need.

Despite the official webpage claims any video converter free edition supports HEVC conversion, we didn't find the HEVC format in the profile list. You may have to upgrade to the ultimate version to process HEVC videos or just switch to another Mac video converter.

**Pros:** 

* Supports all the popular file formats.
* Supports 4K video conversion.
* Excellent filters and effects.
* Supports batch files converting.

**Cons:** 

* Converting a video takes a quite long time.
* Additional software is installed.
* Free edition won't supports HEVC conversion and has many limitations.
* Includes bundled extra software.

**Price:** You have two options to upgrade Any Video Converter Mac, including Any Video Converter Ultimate (priced at $49.95) and Any Video Converter Pro (priced at $39.95) to unlock advanced features, such as DVD Disc/Folder/ISO Image converting, video recording, recording & capturing video screen.

* Supported macOS: Mac OS X 10.14 and earlier
* Rating: ★★★☆☆ 3.9/5 (MacUpdate)

**Best for:** Users who is familiar with using command-line way to convert videos on Mac.

FFmpegX is a graphic user interface for macOS designed to easily operate more than 20 Unix open-source video and audio processing tools like FFmpeg, mpeg2enc, and mencoder. It works as a free video converter for Mac users to convert among different formats, including DIVX, H.264, MOV, MPEG4, AVI, 3GP, and more using mpeg2enc. In most cases, the video conversions are faster than in realtime. More than a Mac video movie converter tool, there are many other tools such as video player, DVD author, subtitle converter, bitrate calculator, video recorder, etc. that you can turn FFmpegX into.

![FFmpegX](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/ffmpegx-mac.jpg)

However, the GUI is not very user-friendly, the very first glance at the app may hold you back, especially for the non-tech savvy users. But it can be very useful once you get familiar with it. It's recommended for those who don't mind a steep learning curve.

Please note, when using FFmepg, MPEG-2 encoding relies on mpeg2enc component from the [mjpegtools package](http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/MacOS/), while DivX and XviD encoding and subtitles support relies on [external mencoder component](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayerosx/).

**Pros:** 

* Supports a wide range of codecs and formats conversion on Mac.
* Fast and reliable.
* Handles subtitles.
* Handles other tasks as well: audio transcoding, denoising, rotation, extracting frames, adding a letterbox, stacking videos, reversing clips, etc.
* Runs natively on an Apple Silicon Mac.

**Cons:** 

* It's not easy for beginners to use.
* Not often updated.

**Price:** It is totally free, and no payment for an upgrade.

### No.11: [Leawo Video Converter](https://shedworx.com/smart-converter/)

## Part 4\. Criteria to Choose the Best Video Converter for Mac

Video conversion is a Mac video converter's bread and butter. And most free video converters for Mac do it simply and painlessly. Yet, that's not all you resort to them. Instead, you need a video converter for Mac computer with more reasons: There are lots of free and paid tools out there, but they vary greatly in terms of performance, features, and price.

To choose the best video converter for Mac from hundreds of options, we think the following 5 basic standards should be kept in mind.

![Criteria to Best Mac Video Converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/video-converter-mac.jpg)

**1\. Ease of use:** For the beginners, the intuitive user interface can help users to learn about the software easily and quickly. A tool showing almost all the functions on the UI would be better. You can download the trial version to see the details as a comprehensive tool often provides free trials for testing out the functions before any payment.

**2\. High-quality and diverse video outputs:** A qualified Mac video converter should have the ability to convert videos on Mac to any format for all devices. For example, MP4, MOV, and M4V are pro-Apple ecosystem while WMV and AVI are frequently used in Windows platforms. Formats of high-definition videos shot by camcorders include DV, AVCHD, MPEG-2, H.264, MTS and others. Chances are that you want to import 4K camcorder footages into your iPhone iPad iMovie or put a media file from Windows 10 to macOS. To avoid the compatibility issue, the video converter should be capable of converting between formats.

**3\. Fast conversion speed:** We need a conversion as fast as possible so that the later jobs can be done in time. Currently, most video converters from famous brands have added Hardware Acceleration support to help speed up the video conversion. That being said, a Hardware-accelerated video converter for Mac is the target you are looking for.

**4\. Cleanness:** Except for the prompts to upgrade or some customer services, a satisfying video converter should come with no ads, extra installations, plug-ins, etc. that will occupy extra space on your computer or may do harm to your computer. This requirement help us exclude the online video converters for Mac as they have so many ads and popups.

**5\. Reasonably priced:** Price is always an important factor when considering a Mac video converter. Often the case, the free version of the software will limit the conversion length, contain watermarks, or limit input/output formats. To avoid the limitations, upgrading to a paid version is suggested. So, a converter has a lower price or value for the money can be picked.

Based on the criteria, the 15 best video converters for Mac are chosen to help convert videos on Mac. For example, MacX Video Converter Pro ($19.95) ranks top on the list because it satisfies all the standards plus extended features, such as [4K video compression](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), video editing, and video recording. While Leawo Video Converter ($25.95) ranks lower for its overall performance doesn’t value for the money. Of course, you can choose your desired one.

### In conclusion:

In short, the overall performance of MacX Video Converter Pro gets the highest mark in our top video conversion freeware Mac review.

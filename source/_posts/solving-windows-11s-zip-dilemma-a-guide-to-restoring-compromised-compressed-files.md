 Are you having trouble opening a ZIP file on your Windows PC? Possibly, the file is corrupted. The good news is that there are a couple of ways to repair a corrupted ZIP file on Windows and view its content.

##  Download the ZIP File Again

 When you try to open a corrupted [ZIP file](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-visual-voyage-amds-radeon-reborn-for-2024/), Windows will display an error message like "Compressed (zipped) Folders Error: Windows cannot open the folder. The Compressed Folder is invalid."

![Corrupt ZIP file prompt on Windows.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/corrupt-zip-file.jpg) 

 In this case, your first step should be to re-download the ZIP file. This can be helpful if the file was corrupted during download due to interruptions like a system crash, [BSOD](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-approaches-to-ppt-video-captures/) or pausing/resuming the download process multiple times. This time, ensure the download completes without any disruptions.

 If you've received the ZIP file through email, ask the sender to send the file again. Make sure to request that they [create a new ZIP file](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/how-neo-qled-stacks-up-against-oled-a-comprehensive-guide/) from scratch with the same files instead of sending the same potentially corrupted file again.

##  Use WinZip Command-Line Utility to Repair the ZIP File

 WinZip is a popular [archive extraction tool for Windows](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-strategies-for-streaming-fb-live-on-zoom-platform/). It also has a command-line utility that you can use to repair corrupted files. To begin with, visit the [WinZip official website](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001524/https://www.winzip.com/en/) and download its free version.

## Fix 1: Remove the peripheral devices

 The first quick fix you can try is to**unplug any unnecessary peripheral devices from your PC** and try to install Windows 10 again. For example, scanners, printers, a secondary monitor, speakers, etc. When any of these devices uses a generic driver, it may interfere with the installation and cause the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error.

 If the installation proceeds and turns out successful, you can plug the devices back in after your system gets updated. But if this doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Clear an attribute of $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error could be triggered when the installer tries to repeatedly copy the files in a certain folder. You can try to clear an attribute of the $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder to see if it solves your problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**E** to open the File Explorer, and navigate to the**C drive** .
2. From the toolbar, click**View** and make sure you tick the checkbox of**Hidden items** .

#### On Windows 7

1. Restart your PC. When you see the manufacturer logo, keep pressing the**F8** key to enter the Advanced Boot Options screen.
2. Use the arrow keys to select**Safe Mode with Command Prompt** , then press**Enter** .

 Once you’ve opened the Command Prompt window, follow the steps below:

1. In the Command Prompt window, type in the following command lines. Make sure you**press Enter after every command line** and wait for it to complete.  

` **bootrec /RebuildBcd**  
 **bootrec /fixMbr**  
 **bootrec /fixboot** `
2. Close the Command Prompt window, and click**Continue** to exit to your desktop.
3. Run the installer again to test the issue.

## Fix 5: Perform a clean boot installation

 Sometimes the programs on your PC may interfere with Windows installation. If you’ve got a specific error code, it’s likely due to an incompatible software or driver. Removing the problematic software or[updating your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) may solve the problem.

 But when that doesn’t help or you don’t have an error code, then you may run a clean boot installation to identify the cause and fix the problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows ke** y, type**msconfig** in the search bar, and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-14-09-1.png)
2. Under the**General** tab, choose**Selective startup** , and make sure**the checkbox of Load startup items is unticked** .

7. Restart your PC and try to run the Windows installer.

 If performing a clean boot installation doesn’t solve the error for you, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 6: Repair corrupted system files

 If the fixes above didn’t solve the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error on your PC, you may be looking at a system-wide error. When the system files required for the Windows installation process are corrupted, it could trigger an installation error. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system corruption, but most of the time, manual repair is required.

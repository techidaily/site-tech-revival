For the latter one, you can first download it in your computer, and then use the USB cable to transfer the download file to your kindle fire. After that, you can follow the instructions to install it in your kindle fire.

FYI - "Part 2 - Read Nook books on Kindle does not apply to the new Fire tablets. 

 This option/choice is not available on the new (Kindle5) tablets: 

 Step 1: Hit the setting icon on the top right corner of your kindle fire. Choose" More ..."- "Device"- "Allow installation of applications" and tag "on".

 Is there any way to hack the new Kindle Fire 7 to be able to download/read Nook books? Silly Amazon is accomplishing nothing by applying this restriction, since many people have ALREADY purchased Nook ebooks that now cannot be read on anything but a cell phone!

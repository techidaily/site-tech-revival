## Experience Timeless Tunes Anew Through SiriusXM's Infinite Music Service

Looking for a different way to listen to music? Get three months of [SiriusXM All Access](https://siriusxm.zgkv.net/c/156932/2017972/4694?subId1=htgdealcontent) for just $1 and enjoy the best parts of radio without the fluff.

 Spotify and YouTube Music are great services, but they're missing something—specifically, that old-school FM radio feel. Of course, you may not have the best memories of radio, with tons of commercials and droning morning shows, but what if you can get the best of radio without the annoying parts?

 This is what [SiriusXM](https://siriusxm.zgkv.net/c/156932/2017972/4694?subId1=htgdealcontent) is. You can download the app or load it up on your desktop, pick a station, and let the tunes stream in real-time. You still have radio DJs, but interruptions are minimal, and the curated song lists are great for finding new music and artists you're likely to love.

 While I have loaded up playlists on other services to find new music to listen to, I often find that there's too much of a mix of what I already listen to and not enough new artists or tracks to enjoy. On the other hand, listening to a SiriusXM station gives me a great list of the most popular hits in a genre, so I can go back to Spotify, search for them, and add something new to my rotation.

 But SiriusXM is about much more than music. In our [SiriusXM All Access review](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-vivo-t2-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/), we mention how it's great for sports fans:

 I’m a big baseball fan so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to listen to every game live. Additionally, the MLB Network Radio station provides something baseball-related 24/7\. There are individual teams’ podcasts and shows mixed in that I found too. There were always people talking about baseball in some fashion. This is also true for other sports like the NBA and NFL.

 SiriusXM has a bit of something for everyone. If you're looking to give the service a try, now is your best chance, too—you can buy three months of All Access service for just $1, which gives you plenty of time to dig into the stations on offer and discover something new.

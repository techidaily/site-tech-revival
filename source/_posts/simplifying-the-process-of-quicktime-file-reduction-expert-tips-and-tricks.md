This will inevitably bring about some issues with the QuickTime video.

**Step 1: Load QuickTime video to the program.** 

[![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mobile/article-image/down-icon.png) Free download](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)VideoProc and launch on your Mac computer.

**Step 2: Reduce QuickTime video size.** 

There are many factors affect the size of a video, such as video format, codec used for encoding the QT file, parameters like video resolution, bitrate, frame rate, and dimension of video. On top of that, the two major factors affecting the video size are the video length itself and bitrate. Longer video will give rise to bigger size, so do the bitrate. Luckily, this tool gives you an access to compress QuickTime videos with all these means. 

▶ **Choose output format.** As the video loaded, there pops up a window for choosing output format. It all depends on your needs. Naturally, formats like MP4, FLV etc. are smaller than MOV. Optimally, **MP4 is the best format** you can choose, whether you want to upload video to YouTube, send over email or play or store in mobile devices. Thus you can convert MOV to MP4 to decrease video size, or continue the MOV format and reduce video size with ways below. 

▶   **Set video parameters.** Just click on ![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../seoimage/vcp-gear-icon.png) icon to enter a window for parameters adjustment. Here you can choose the lower resolution, like lower 4K to 1080p, 1080p to 720p/640/480p, lower video frame rate from 30fps to 24fps, change aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3, downscale the bitrate of video and audio, choose video codec with advanced video compression ratio such as **HEVC, H.264**. Generally, we suggestion you **do not make any change of the frame rate**. Any lower or up of the fps will make video playback stuttering and even show with mosaic. And bitrate is recommended to reduced to **20-30%** in order to keep a good balance between file size and quality.

▶   **Trim the video length.** Click on ![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/vcp-edit.png) button on the main interface, choose Trim and check the box of Enable trimming, then set the Start/End Time. Meanwhile, if you video has black bars or any other unwanted parts, you can also choose to crop them off: Crop & Expand > Enable Crop > adjust the position and size. 

**Step 3: Start Shrinking QuickTime video on Mac right now.**

Click Browse button to save the result video where you like and then hit RUN icon to start shrinking QuickTime MOV video in a flash.

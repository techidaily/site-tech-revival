It's no doubt that Kindle Fire is a good tablet. But it's far from perfect. Actually we can find several defects on it easily. One of the defects which most people could not accept is that you can't replace the wallpaper. First, you can't find any wallpaper setting options on Kindle Fire; second, even if you set a picture as wallpaper via some third party apps, the system will turn it back to original wall paper once you lock the screen.

So is there a valid method to custom our own wallpaper successfully? The answer is yes. As long as you root your Kindle Fire, this can be an easy job. Now just follow the tutorial below and you will learn how to set a beautiful wallpaper.

PS: This tutorial is only for rooted Kindle Fire. If you haven't rooted your device, please refer to these two articles: [How to root Kindle Fire](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and [Root Kindle Fire with one click](http://ebookconverter.blogspot.com/2013/07/root-kindle-fire-with-one-click.html#.UfB9SW1cac9).

### **Step 1: Install QuickPic**

QuickPic is an efficient picture viewer. It allows you to set any picture as wallpaper. [Click here to download QuickPic](http://quickpic.en.uptodown.com/android).

### **Step 2: Set wallpaper**

Open QuickPic and choose a picture which you want to set as wallpaper. Tap the picture and then tap the top right corner of the window. Choose "Set as" option in the drop-down menu.

![how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-set-wallpaper](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-set-wallpaper-copy.jpg)

Drag the box to adjust the wallpaper size. Click "save" and it will be saved and set as wallpaper.

Until this step, you may not find anything different as these are normal operation. If you just lock the screen as you did before and want to see the new wallpaper (I mean "if", please don't lock the screen now), you'll find the new custom wallpaper doesn't work. The boring original wallpaper comes into your eyes again!

This is due to the fact the system will set the original wallpaper as new wallpaper forcedly every time you lock the screen. So we need to revoke the system's "write" permission so that it can't modify any data again.

Remember not to lock the screen before step 3!

### **Step 3: Revoke permission**

Open ES File Explore and navigate to this path: **/data/data/com.android.settings/files/**. You can find a file called "wallpaper". Press on it and choose "More" â€“ "Properties".

![how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-change-permission](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/6-how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-change-permission.jpg)

Choose "Permission" and tap "change". Revoke the "**write**" permission of "**Owner**" and "**Group**" (They have **write** permission by default). Tap "OK" to confirm revoking.

![how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-revoke-write-permission](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/7-how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-revoke-write-permission.jpg)

Now the system won't modify the wallpaper any more. Lock the screen and press the power button, you'll find the custom wallpaper works!

![how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-new-wallpaper](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/8-how-to-change-kindle-fire-wallpaper-new-wallpaper.png)

Next time you change the wallpaper, please restore the "**write**" permission of "**Owner**" and "**Group**" first, then revoke it after you set wallpaper.

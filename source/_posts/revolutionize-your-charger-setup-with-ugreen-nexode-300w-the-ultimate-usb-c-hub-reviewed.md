 Measuring 3.5 inches tall, 2 inches wide, 4.25 inches from front to back, and weighing 1.89 pounds, the Ugreen Nexode 300W is a no-brainer addition to any laptop bag. It’s compact enough to fit in most sleeves and pockets, and it’s one of the lighter [USB hubs](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/) I’ve ever tested. In terms of appearance, this is definitely a sleek-looking peripheral. A matte-gray shell covers the sides and top of the Nexode, with black plating encasing the front-facing USB port section and the rear power terminal. Black rubber padding is used underneath, along with two rubber lifts that can help keep the Nexode from sliding around on desks and tables.

 Depending on how you like to position your USB hub, you can certainly lay the Nexode 300W on its side, which gives you slightly easier access to the USB ports—mostly when you have more than one device plugged in at the same time. Keep in mind that there’s zero padding on the left and right sides of the device if you do want to lay it down. Not only could you scuff up the Nexode, but you could damage your precious desk, too.

 As far as cables and other accessories go, the Nexode 300W comes with a 6.6-foot power cable, a 4.9-foot [USB-C cable](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) with tough but flexible bungee-style jacketing, and a user manual.

##  Charging Capabilities: USB-C is the Name of the Game

 The Nexode 300W raises Ugreen to all-new heights with its chart-topping 300 watts of power distribution. I kid you not, friends: When all five USB ports are in use, the Nexode 300W will deliver close to its advertised maximum power output (a whopping 287.5 watts). I’m going to guess that the remaining 12.5 watts are used to keep the internal GaN components running smoothly. Plus, it’s hard to complain about an iota of missing power when the Nexode’s Power Delivery 3.1 USB-C port pushes up to 140 watts to your MacBook Pro (using a MagSafe-certified cable) and will do so no matter how many other devices are connected to the hub.

 As far as single-port charging goes, the two middle USB-C ports deliver 100 watts to your connected gear, while the bottom USB-C pushes 45 watts. At 22.5 watts (no matter how many other devices are connected), that lone-wolf USB-A is no weakling!

 With three-port charging, one of the middle USB-C connections drops to 60 watts when three USB-C devices are plugged in. With four-port charging, you lose a little more juice from a couple of the USB-C connections (unless you’re not using the 140-watt port). When each and every port is used, the second USB-C pushes 60 watts, the third pushes 45 watts, and the bottom USB-C pushes 20 watts.

 This amazing power hierarchy can be attributed to the GaN-optimized engineering that Ugreen has come to be known for. For those unaware, GaN is an abbreviation of gallium-nitride, a type of material used in the development of charging stations like the Nexode. Intended as a replacement for silicone, GaN chargers are able to be much smaller than traditional silicone power stations, and they’re also more energy-efficient.

##  Using the Ugreen Nexode 300W: All the Power You’ll Need

![Charging electronics with the UGreen Nexode 300W GaN Charger.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/charging-electronics-with-the-ugreen-nexode-300w-gan-desktop-charger-1jpg_53044705182_o.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 I’ve tested a lot of different [USB charging stations](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and while I can usually find plenty of things to like about these products, my “cons” list usually includes two or three features or design elements. Honestly, the only demerit I can issue to the Ugreen Nexode 300W is its $270 price. But we live in a consumer tech world of “you get what you pay for,” and for almost three big bills, the Nexode 300W does a truly awesome job at charging mobile devices and laptops.

 I tested a few different charging configurations and received great results during each cycle. To see what would happen when I pushed the Nexode close to its maximum output, I connected a MacBook Pro with the Nexode-supplied USB-C cable to the top USB-C port, an AirPods Pro 2 case to the second USB-C, my girlfriend’s iPhone 12 to the third USB-C, and my own iPhone 12 to the singular USB-A port. With all these devices plugged in, the MacBook’s battery went from 78% to 94% in less than half an hour. As for our iPhones, my girlfriend’s went from 24% to 78% in forty minutes, while my own iPhone went from 53% to 85% in the same amount of time. My AirPods Pro case charged quickly too, climbing from 67% to 94% in a little less than forty minutes.

 I also tested the single 140W USB-C with my power-hungry Sony WHC710N Bluetooth headphones. When I plugged them in at 4:39, I had 20% or less battery remaining. At 5:37, the battery was up to 70%. I’ve tested Thunderbolt 4 charging stations with bigger power supplies and higher price tags that didn’t deliver the same kind of stellar charging experience as the Nexode 300W.

 This brick-sized USB-C hub was quite the little beast. But even with all the equipment connected, the hub never became too warm.

##  Should You Buy the Ugreen Nexode 300W GaN Desktop Charger?

 If you can afford it, the Ugreen Nexode 300W GaN Desktop Charger is worth buying. I give it a solid two-thumbs up. It’s small enough to travel with or keep housed at your workstation, is made from ultra-efficient gallium-nitride, and pushes a massive amount of power out of all its USB ports (including that standalone USB-A).

**Get the Hardware before DVD Ripping** 

In case there is no DVD drive, please get an external DVD drive such as Apple's $80 model USB SuperDrive, or a drive as cheap as $30-$40 on Amazon.

On the one hand, these are the announcement of MPAA and disc publishers that you are not allowed and may violate the copyright law if you copy or rip these DVDs for any commercial use. Frankly, you can actually manage your property for personal use and to rip a DVD you actually own to avoid any scratches or damages is OK, to some degree.

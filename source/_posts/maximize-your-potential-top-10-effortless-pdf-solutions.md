![ChatGPT Jailbreak Prompts on Reddit Communities](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/reddit-community-for-chatgpt-prompts.jpg)

 ChatGPT has less rigid restrictions than other chatbots. For instance, Bing Chat automatically terminates conversations that go against its guidelines, while ChatGPT still responds. You can generate different outputs by rephrasing your prompts.

 The below image shows ChatGPT rejecting a request to portray a manga character.

![ChatGPT Refusing to Act Like Tomie Character](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-rejecting-roleplay-request-1.jpg)

 After rephrasing the instructions and adding more details, it quickly obliged.

![A Facebook Group for Sharing and Posting ChatGPT Prompts ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-group-chatgpt-prompt-engineers.jpg)

 ChatGPT Prompt Engineers is a decent community for beginners. Members just typically ask general knowledge questions about writing prompts and getting optimal outputs. You won’t have trouble keeping up with discussions.

 We also like that the moderators proactively weed out spam marketers and shady ads. Many[crooks abuse ChatGPT to execute cyberattacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-cybersecurity-threat/) nowadays. Even tech-savvy individuals could fall victim to them if they’re not careful. So minimize your exposure to scams altogether.

## 5.[Midjourney Prompt Tricks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1192421464638601)

![A Facebook Group for Sharing Midjourney Prompts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/midjourney-prompts-facebook-group.jpg)

 Midjourney ranks among the[most popular text-to-art generators online](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) . Its sophisticated AI architecture was trained on much broader datasets, allowing it to generate more realistic elements.

 With that said, utilizing Midjourney is also challenging. It requires more technical and precise prompts than other AI art generators. Many newbies can only write basic prompts.

 To craft better text-to-image prompts, join the Midjourney Prompt Tricks Facebook group. Users trade prompts here. Take inspiration from workflows that match your art style; you don’t have to waste time writing prompts from scratch.

 Try some[AI art prompt tricks](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-art-prompt-ideas/) to get your creative juices flowing. See how phrasing affects the way your output. You’ll notice specific phrases and keywords that trigger different image elements.

![Reddit Community for Stable Diffusion Prompts and Output](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stablediffusion-prompts-on-reddit.jpg)

 r/StableDiffusion is the largest subreddit dedicated to Stable Diffusion. The community allows sharing workflows. However, it primarily encourages users to post outputs and discuss relevant AI news—prompt engineering is merely a part of generating AI art.

 The group might be helpful if you prefer Stable Diffusion over Midjourney and Dall-E models. Study the system’s limits and capabilities. Users post various media forms, including 3D images, 2D portraits, and animations.

 Meanwhile, artists who prefer other text-to-image models could use the group for comparisons. See which system provides the best outputs. You might even find Stable Diffusion users testing your preferred art styles frequently.

![LinkedIn Group to Share AI Tips for Salespeople and Marketers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/linkedin-ai-group.jpg)

 It’s currently the largest AI community on LinkedIn. The group has around a million members worldwide, many of whom post regularly. It gets status updates every few minutes.

 As its name suggests, the community focuses on the applications of AI in sales, marketing, and social media ads. Most just share prompts. But you’ll also find engaging discussions about[automating work tasks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tasks-freelancers-should-automate/) , like lead generation, appointment setting, and client management.

 The admins are relatively active. Every few weeks, they upload relevant resources, like websites, PDFs, and tools. You can also connect with them for queries. Just don’t expect an immediate response unless you already have mutuals.

 Perhaps the only downside is the group gets plenty of spam. You might have to scroll through aggressive ads and campaigns before finding valuable content.

## Connect With Fellow Professionals in the AI Industry

 AI is constantly evolving. No individual can keep up with every AI-driven platform, model, or method that global tech leaders release. You’d do well to join communities instead. Connect with like-minded professionals, discuss AI’s real-life applications, and gain reliable insights into new systems. You can only test so many tools yourself, after all.

 If you enjoy working with AI systems and models, build a career in them. Choose roles that suit your skill set. For instance, experienced coders can look into programming and developing, while communication graduates might thrive as prompt engineers.

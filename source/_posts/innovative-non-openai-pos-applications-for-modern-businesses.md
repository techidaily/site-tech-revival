 WOMBO Dream is an AI art generator tool that lets you[create images from text prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) , just like Midjourney or DALL-E. The app is easy to use and allows you to choose from different art styles such as anime, retro, comic, realistic, fantastical, steampunk, polygon, and more.

 If you have a photo in your gallery that you want to use as a reference for your art, you can add that to the app and write a prompt on top describing what changes you want.

 To get more accurate results, you can even adjust how strong you want the AI to be. You can also choose from different aspect ratios for posting on social media, but it's one of the features locked behind a premium subscription.

 Youper is a[mental health chatbot](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-chatbot-therapist-mobile-apps-pocket/) that uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to "help you calm anxiety, improve your relationships, be more productive, and improve your mood." It's meant for those who don't have the time to visit a therapist in-person every week.

 The app contains a range of mindfulness activities like breathing exercises, a deep body scan, and various types of meditation. As you use the app on a daily basis, it tracks your mood and develops insights showing your progress over time in reducing anxiety and feeling calmer.

 After five days of daily check-ins, the app develops insights to show your changing emotional states. Do note that features like health monitoring and anxiety screening are locked behind a premium subscription, so you won't be able to track your progress unless you pay for it.

 Replika is an AI chatbot companion app designed for "anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved." You can select the appearance of your AI companion and choose what relationship you want to have with them, including a friend, sibling, mentor, or romantic partner.

 Over time, the AI learns facts about you and your interests to try to make conversations feel more natural. In our testing, however, the chatbot sometimes made stuff up, which felt a bit weird. But if you can ignore the occasional hiccups, it's a fun app to pass some time.

## There's an AI App for Almost Everything

 As amazing as these AI tools are, it's wise to remember that—all things considered—the technology is still in its infancy and is likely to deliver inaccurate, inappropriate, irrelevant, or unwanted results sometimes.

 The good news is that AI is growing exponentially, so a lot of the complaints that we currently have will likely be addressed sooner than you might expect, and its benefits will be available for us all to reap. Still, it's never a bad idea to proceed with caution.

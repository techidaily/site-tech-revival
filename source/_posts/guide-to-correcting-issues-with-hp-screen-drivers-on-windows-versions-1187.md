![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amd-560.jpg)

 If you’re using an AMD RX 560 graphics card and it’s constantly underperforming, there might be something wrong with your graphics driver.

 Driver is an essential piece of software that enables your devices to communicate with the operating system. That said, if your RX 560 driver is faulty or outdated, you will encounter various performance issues such as the driver not working or crashing. To avoid this, you should always keep your graphics driver up-to-date.

## How to update your RX 560 driver

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/amd-rx-560-driver-download-and-update/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

2. Select**Graphics** \>**Radeon 500 Series** \>**Radeon RX 500 Series** \>**Radeon RX 560** . Then click**Submit** .

### Option 2 – Automatically update the RX 560 driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your RX 560 driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you could click**Update** next to the AMD Radeon RX 560 driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

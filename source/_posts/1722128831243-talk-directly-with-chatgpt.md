## What You Need to Speak to ChatGPT

 ChatGPT's Whisper integration allows you to use your voice to speak with ChatGPT instead of typing. The beauty of this lies in the fact that you can speed up your prompts instead of typing long and descriptive sentences.

 To access ChatGPT's voice input feature on your phone, you'll need to download and install the official ChatGPT app for mobile devices. Once you sign in with your OpenAI account, you're all set to take advantage of the Whisper feature.

## How to Send ChatGPT Prompts With Your Voice

 Both iPhones and Android devices come with native dictation features. And that's what you'll use to take advantage of ChatGPT's Whisper integration on your phone.

 To send prompts in the ChatGPT app with your voice, follow these simple steps in the ChatGPT mobile app.

1. On an iPhone, tap the **sound wave** icon on the right side of the text field at the bottom. On an Android device, tap the **microphone** button next to the text field.
2. ChatGPT will immediately start recording your voice. So, start speaking.
3. When you're done, hit **Tap to stop recording** and wait for ChatGPT to transcribe the recording.
4. Tap the **Send** button next to the text field to send your prompt.

##  Design: The Past Meets the Future

 The Keychron Lemokey L3 is one heck of a big keyboard, which should bode well for gamers who need the expanded footprint and customizable keys. This is quite the heavy peripheral, too, to the point where I found myself exercising caution when handling the device near my MacBook. (I was afraid I would accidentally drop it on my computer.) That’s not necessarily a bad thing though. In fact, I’d be willing to bet most gamers want a hefty and durable keyboard to work with. Let’s hope so at any rate, because the L3 weighs a whopping 4.4 pounds.

 Available in Carbon Black, Navy Blue, and Space Silver casing colors, you’ll also be able to purchase Gateron Jupiter Brown, Red, and Banana-colored switches. My test unit was a fully assembled Space Silver model, but you can also purchase the L3 as a barebones device with no keys or switches. Similar to other Keychron [mechanical models](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/social-sensation-best-insta-stories-effects/), such as the Q2 and Q3, the L3 is slightly angled toward the user, which is helpful for taking some strain off your wrists. I also found it easier to make contact with the larger-than-normal keys.

 I was amazed at how effectively the company was able to squeeze an 80% keyboard layout onto a 96% aluminum chassis. On the far left of the L3, a rotating knob and set of four programmable macro keys take up an entire column-worth of space. The rest of the layout is taken up by a traditional QWERTY spread, with the addition of three LED indicators to the far right. The left-most represents charging status, the center indicates what wireless method is being used (Bluetooth or 2.4GHz), and the right-most indicator is for caps lock.

 You’ll also find a grille at the bottom-right of the keyboard, which houses the L3’s wireless antenna. At the top left of the device, you’ll find a USB-C port and control toggle for easy switching between Bluetooth, wired, or 2.4GHz connections.

##  Connectivity: Three Different Control Methods

![Dial on the Keychron Lemokey L3](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/dial-on-the-keychron-lemokey-l3_53267985171_o.jpg)

 Any PC gamer will tell you that you want to be working with a solid polling rate for your keyboard or mouse, especially when you’re in the thick of an intense multiplayer battle. Not to worry though, because the Lemokey L3 has got what it takes to dive into the FPS trenches. This is thanks in part to the lightning-fast 2.4GHz wireless control method, which pushes up to 1,000Hz.

 I experienced next to no latency when using the 2.4GHz connection, and could easily see myself relying on this one method alone for most games. Keychron also thought to include Bluetooth 5.1 with Multipoint support for up to three devices, which makes it simple to switch between your phone, tablet, and full-fledged [gaming rig](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-12-prominent-oppo-fingerprint-not-working-solutions-by-drfone-android/) without having to un-pair and re-pair the L3.

 There’s also a wired USB-C mode for those of us wanting to bypass wireless connectivity altogether. Once connected to my MacBook, all I had to do was enter a couple of confirmation taps to register the L3, and I was off and running.

 As far as customization goes, the Lemokey L3 also works with [QMK/VIA](https://www.keychron.com/blogs/news/why-qmk-via-is-one-of-the-most-essential-features-for-a-custom-keyboard) software, which is one of the best ways to assign macros, create shortcuts, and manipulate the RGB lighting on this gaming keyboard. I also like the fact that QMK/VIA allows you to create multiple keyboard profiles [for different games](https://win11.techidaily.com/essential-tips-for-lowering-wlanext-cpu-usage/).

##  Typing and Comfort: Less Strain than Expected

 It had been years since I used a full-on [mechanical keyboard](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and when testing the L3, I was completely lost in a happy world of satisfying sensations. From the firm tick-tacking sound of the keys to the pitched design of the L3’s housing, the keyboard is equal parts a blast from the past and a modern gaming stalwart.

 This isn’t going to be a good match for all users though. For anyone who’s acclimated to low-profile keyboards that are built into most laptops and available as standalone products (like myself), it’s hard to imagine the L3 as a daily-use device. But if you’re an everyday gamer, or the type of person who doesn’t mind the feel of a mechanical keyboard, Keychron built the L3 to be as comfortable as possible.

 With its double-gasket mount and foam padding, the L3’s keystrokes are a lot quieter than one might expect when seeing how large the keys are. And as mentioned, the angled chassis reduces overall strain on your wrists and fingers. After using the L3 for several hours, I felt no pain or discomfort whatsoever. That being said, I was glad to return to my MacBook’s flattened keyboard layout, but only because it’s the type of keyboard I've become accustomed to.

##  Battery Life: A Better Indicator Would Have Been Nice

![The Keychron Lemokey L3 plugged in](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/the-keychron-lemokey-l3plugged-in_53268452015_o.jpg)

 The Lemokey L3 is equipped with a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery that the company claims should last for up to 200 hours when in 2.4GHz mode, and up to 300 hours when the keyboard is set to Bluetooth.

 At no point during my testing did I ever actually have to do a full recharge on the L3\. I wanted to test the charge indicator though, so I connected the keyboard (using the supplied USB-C cable) to my Mophie portable battery. It took about two hours for the L3 to completely recharge, which is signaled by a solid green light on the left-most LED indicator.

 I do wish that Keychron would have put a battery-percentage readout on the L3 instead of just a red and green status light. No one wants to lose an online match because of a dead keyboard, but a battery life countdown could inform gamers as to exactly how much time is left on the L3’s charge.

##  Should You Buy the Keychron Lemokey L3?

 I think the [Keychrom Lemokey L3](https://www.keychron.com/products/lemokey-l3-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) is an impressive keyboard that effectively merges a mechanized past with a next-gen gaming future. As far as the $215 price goes, when you compare it to other great gaming gear like the [Asus X901 Strix Scope II](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-II-Switch-Dampening-Hot-Swappable-PBT/dp/B0C7KFZ5TL/ref=asc%5Fdf%5FB0C7KFZ5TL/?tag=hotoge-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=663421494129&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5556781703997205516&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004840&hvtargid=pla-2190164818697&psc=1&mcid=388058f99a55345092856c0a0e64a2b3&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000965&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkeychron-lemokey-l3-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), and the [Logitech G915](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tactile/dp/B07NY9ZRZG/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=3SQPMR2VKNUAN&keywords=logitech+g915&qid=1699546788&s=electronics&sprefix=logitech+g915%2Celectronics%2C79&sr=1-3&ufe=app%5Fdo%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000965&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkeychron-lemokey-l3-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), the L3 does come out on the pricier side. That being said, having the ability to switch between three different control methods, along with custom macros and shortcuts through QMK/VIA, certainly makes the Lemokey L3 hard to resist. Not to mention it just looks rad.

### Key Takeaways

* OpenAI is releasing a ChatGPT desktop version, starting with macOS and later for Windows.
* However, an open-source ChatGPT desktop version is available as an alternative.
* The official version is slowly rolling out to users, but it's a slow process.

 As part of its massive 2024 Spring Update, OpenAI revealed that a long-awaited ChatGPT desktop version was incoming.

 Starting with macOS, OpenAI is officially bringing ChatGPT to desktops, with Windows support coming later.

 But if you can't wait—like me!—you can try a free, open-source version instead.

## What Is the Open-Source ChatGPT Desktop Application?

 ChatGPT users have long wanted a desktop version. The world's leading generative AI chatbot works great in a browser, but sometimes, a desktop app is more convenient.

[OpenAI's Spring Update launched GPT-4o](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-gpt-4o-works-is-it-free/) among a host of[other shiny new ChatGPT features](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-new-features-spring-update/) , wowing the world with its new capabilities.

 The long-awaited desktop version was one of them—but intrepid ChatGPT users need to wait a little longer.

 Developer[Lencx's open source ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT) gives you the option to try a desktop version right now, without waiting. It's a website wrapper that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so it's a little basic, but it replicates the functionality of the website, and does a really good job, too.

 The project's development is currently paused as the official desktop versions are coming soon. The developer says, "I am currently looking for some differentiating features to develop version 2.0." Still, the latest version, V1.1.0, works fine at the time of writing.

## When Is the Official ChatGPT Desktop Version Launching?

 The official ChatGPT Desktop app is already slowly rolling out to macOS users.

 As with many of OpenAI's major updates, it takes time to filter through to the majority, and a Windows version will take longer still.

 Still, if you can't wait, you can give this open-source ChatGPT desktop version a try instead.

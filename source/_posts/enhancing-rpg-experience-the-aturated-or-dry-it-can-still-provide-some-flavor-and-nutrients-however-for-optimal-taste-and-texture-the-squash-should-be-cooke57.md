## Experience the Ultimate Free Guide to Mastering GPT-4 with Copilot Assistance

 With AI chatbots becoming mainstream, companies are locking their most powerful features behind subscription paywalls. However, some companies allow free users to do more things than others. As such, if you'd like to give GPT-4 Turbo a try, using Microsoft's Copilot tool is the best way to do it.

## What Is GPT-4 Turbo?

 If this is the first you've heard of GPT-4 Turbo, it's one of the more advanced AI models at the time of writing. It's designed by OpenAI, the people who invented the[wildly popular ChatGPT service](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/) .

 To put GPT-4 Turbo into perspective; when ChatGPT went viral, it was using the 3.5 model. After that, OpenAI released the GPT-4 model, which could handle queries better and sounded more human. Finally, they made the model process faster and thus arrived at GPT-4 Turbo.

 Right now, the best way to use GPT-4 Turbo for free is via Microsoft Copilot. It may seem weird that you have to go through Microsoft instead of OpenAI, but the two companies have a really close relationship. As such, it's not unusual to see OpenAI's features appear within Microsoft's AI assistants.

## How to Use GPT-4 Turbo for Free With Microsoft Copilot

 To get started with GPT-4 Turbo, just boot up Copilot and start talking with it. At the time of writing, Copilot will use GPT-4 Turbo by default when talking to a user on the free tier. Paid users can go back to previous models if they wish, but you don't need to worry about that if you just want to use the latest and greatest model.

## Who Can Harness the Potential of NVIDIA’s Adaptable AI Foundations? An Examination of Its Functionality and Reach

 On March 21st, 2023, NVIDIA announced the introduction of its generative AI model that can be customized to help businesses, generate artwork, and assist with medical research.

 Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Microsoft Bing AI, and Google Bard have wowed us, and now GPU manufacturer NVIDIA wants a piece of the pie.

## What Is NVIDIA AI Foundations?

 NVIDIA AI Foundations is a cloud-based generative AI service that you can fine-tune for your business, use for medical research, or generate AI artwork. The AI models can be trained to produce texts, images, videos, and 3D content unique to your enterprise. This is particularly useful if you can't afford to build a customized AI model for your business because it's too expensive or complicated.

 Of course, it could also be a convenient option if you're worried about sharing your company's sensitive data with other AI models because of privacy and copyright concerns.

 NVIDIA AI Foundations is available in three models: NeMo, Picasso, and BioNeMo.

### NVIDIA NeMo

[NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/nemo-llm-service/) service works similarly to ChatGPT, but it's specifically pre-trained for businesses. This means you can train the AI model by adding special skills and knowledge to define its objectives in tune with your business.

 For instance, you could integrate NVIDIA NeMo cloud service for customer service and marketing content. Once you've trained the AI model using data from your business, the AI model can mimic your brand's personality and tone. This could also help the AI model to be more accurate since they mostly rely on private data from your business.

 NVIDIA NeMo cloud service can also be fine-tuned not to answer questions beyond its scope. In other words, you can customize the AI model to only help with queries for your business while locking out sensitive topics like politics or religion that are irrelevant to your business.

 There are five NeMo models available with different parameters ranging from 8 billion parameters to 530 billion. If you're unsure which is the most suitable AI model for your business, you can consult an NVIDIA AI expert to help you.

[NVIDIA Picasso](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/) is a generative AI model that works similarly to[OpenAI's DALL-E image creator](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dall-e-ai-image-generator/) . However, NVIDIA Picasso is not limited to images only since it can also turn text into video or 3D content.

 In addition, NVIDIA Picasso is made for software creators, service providers, and businesses intending to train AI models using copyright or licensed data. Alternatively, using pre-trained models, you could add text prompts to create images, videos, and 3D content from scratch.

## NVIDIA BioNeMo

[NVIDIA's BioNeMo](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-services-to-advance-life-sciences-r-d) is a pre-trained AI model for biology, chemistry, genomics, and molecular dynamics research. To put into perspective, NVIDIA's BioNemo will speed up the process of drug development—a process that used to take years could be shortened to a few weeks.

 Beyond that, pharmaceutical scientists can choose from six different AI models of BioNemo depending on their scope of research. This could revolutionize[the future of the healthcare industry](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-will-power-future-healthcare/) .

 NVIDIA's AI Foundations isn't available to the general public. However, you can request early access by filling up your company's details on NVIDIA's website. Once your business application is approved, you can access the AI models through a browser or[a dedicated API](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-api/) .

 So far, a few companies like Getty Images, Adobe, and Shutterstock have partnered with NVIDIA to develop text-to-image or video AI models. Similarly, more than a dozen big companies, including Deloitte and Morningstar, have already implemented NVIDIA's AI language models into their business operations. Biotech companies like Amgen and Insilico Medicine are also using NVIDIA's BioNeMo to develop drugs.

## NVIDIA'S AI Foundation is a Game Changer

 NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud to develop its AI model for businesses. On top of that, NVIDIA has decades of experience building the best GPUs on the market—for example, OpenAI used NVIDIA GPUs to develop ChatGPT.

 With NVIDIA finally jumping on board, you can access its AI model and customize it to easily perform tasks that fall within the parameters of your business. In addition, you can also adopt NVIDIA's AI Foundations to improve your organization's efficiency and accuracy.

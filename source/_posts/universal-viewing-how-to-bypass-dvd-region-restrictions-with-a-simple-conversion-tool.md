##  Part 3\. How to Make DVD Player Region Free for TV

For users who need to play region code 2 DVD in region code 1 or region code 3 areas via HDTV set, they can of course choose multi-region DVD player, which supports region-free DVD playback from region code 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\. Yet, the only downside is that it will cost you an arm and a leg. Thus, if you're a budget-minded user, you're advised to make DVD player region free for TV via DVD player hack. 

VideoHelp forum offers you a free yet helpful place with a boatload of unlocking codes for different DVD player brands and models. Here are some general steps you can give a shot:

**Step 1\.**  Look for the brand and model of your DVD player online. Search for the phrase "region free code" along with your DVD player's brand and model to see if anyone has posted instructions on how to make it region-free.

**Step 2\.**  Try entering a code into the DVD player using the remote control. You can find these codes online, but be sure to only use a code from a reputable source. General steps are listed below:

1. Turn on the DVD player > open the tray.
2. Press the appropriate button on the remote control to bring up the setup menu. This may be labeled "Setup," "Menu," or something similar.
3. Look for an option in the setup menu that lets you change the region code. This may be labeled "Region," "Region Code," or "Country Code."
4. Enter the appropriate code using the remote control. You may need to press a sequence of buttons or use a specific combination of keys to enter the code.
5. Once you've entered the code, the DVD player should be region-free. Test it by inserting a DVD from another region and see if it plays.

![unlock DVD player region code](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-player-for-tv.jpg) 

**Step 3\.** If you're not comfortable entering a code into your DVD player or can't find a reliable source, you can also consider purchasing a region-free DVD player or called multi-region DVD player. These players are designed to play DVDs from any region without requiring any modifications or codes. 

Well, if you're still puzzled about how to unlock DVD player region code, here we take **Samsung DVD players** for instance. Please note that the following steps may not work for all models of Samsung DVD players, and attempting to make modifications to your DVD player may void its warranty. Proceed at your own risk.

**Step 1\.** Turn on your Samsung DVD player and open the disc tray. 

**Step 2\.**  Using your remote control, press the following buttons in order: Repeat, **57538**, and then the corresponding region code (1-6 for specific regions, 0 for region-free). Note that the unlock code for DVD player from different regions are different. For example, the code for Samsung DVD player bought in UK won't work for players from the US.

 List of unlocking codes for different regions:

* Region 1: 29334
* Region 2: 57538 (or 38767)
* Region 3: 56732
* Region 4: 76884
* Region 5: 53814
* Region 6: 24462

1. Turn on your Samsung DVD player and open the disc tray.
2. Holding your remote control, press the following buttons in order: Menu, 1, 9, and then the corresponding region code (1-6 for specific regions, 0 for region-free).

Why do we have region codes on DVD? Shortly, money. The film distribution companies need to protect their profits to the maximum degree. Picture this, a movie is released in the U.S.A in January, and its DVD version comes to the public in the U.S market in June 2022 while it makes its debut in Spain in July 2022\. So what will happen if an American friend sends the DVD version of this movie to his friends in Spain? The box office will flop in Spain. That's where the region codes for DVD discs come for. However, region codes bring incovenience for those who collect and play DVD movies from different regions. Therefore, those users need to bypass and unlock DVD region code.

As we mentioned before, you can choose to change DVD region code for momentarily removing DVD region codes, rely on DVD player hack in VideoHelp forum to make DVD player region free or trust top region free DVD ripper to permanently remove DVD region code. Make your final decision based on your specific needs.

 OpenAI's GPT-4 is one of the most popular and capable large language models (LLMs). Most people access GPT-4 using a ChatGPT Plus subscription, but this costs $20 per month.

But what if you don't want to part with $20 per month?

Well, here are five ways you can use GPT-4 for free.

![microsoft copilot website screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/microsoft-copilot-website-screenshot.png)

 Microsoft was one of the first companies to work directly with OpenAI, plowing billions of dollars into the company and its AI research.

 Accordingly, Microsoft Edge's Bing Chat became one of the first ways to use GPT-4 for free, allowing you to create up to 300 chats per day, with each Bing Chat limited to 30 rounds of questions. Then, on December 1, 2023, Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot, dropping the 300 chats per day limit and rolling out[Copilot support in many other Microsoft services](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-ai-copilot-which-you-should-use/) .

 Copilot has other boons, too. For example, you can[use OpenAI's DALL-E 3 text-to-image tool for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-dalle-3-free-microsoft-bing/) , enabling you to create highly detailed original images with text input.[Copilot Image Creator works similarly to OpenAI's tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-bing-image-creator-free/) , with some slight differences between the two. Still, you can use it to create unique AI images almost instantaneously.

![microsoft copilot image creator four images](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/microsoft-copilot-image-creator-four-images.jpg)

 If you want to use GPT-4 for free, Microsoft Copilot is absolutely one of the best options. A[ChatGPT Plus subscription is still the overall best option](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-should-upgrade-chatgpt-plus/) due to its extensive array of features, but if you just have a few questions you want answered, Copilot is the next best option.

## 2\. ChatGPT

 Wait, ChatGPT offers GPT-4 for free?[OpenAI launched a heap of new features](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-new-features-spring-update/) at its Spring Update event in May 2024, and one of those was a new GPT-4 version: GPT-4o.

![chatgpt gpt-4o option in web browser](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chatgpt-gpt-4o-option-in-web-browser.jpg)

[GPT-4o is completely free to all ChatGPT users](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-gpt-4o-works-is-it-free/) , albeit with some considerable limitations for those without a ChatGPT Plus subscription. For starters, ChatGPT free users can only send around 16 GPT-4o messages within a three-hour period. Once you hit the message limit, ChatGPT will block access to GPT-4o.

 Second, although GPT-4o is a fully multimodal AI model, it doesn't support DALL-E image creation. While that is an unfortunate restriction, it's also not a huge problem, as you can easily use Microsoft Copilot.

 Free GPT-4o access comes with some excellent features, though. ChatGPT free users can use GPT-4o for web browsing searches and questions, data analysis, image analysis, and extensive file support. So, it brings many of the core features of the ChatGPT Plus tier to free users. It also allows free users to access custom GPTs, though these have the same limits as GPT-4o messaging (and free users cannot make custom GPTs, only interact with them).

## 3.[Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

![perplexity ai pro search option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/perplexity-ai-pro-search-option.jpg)

 Perplexity.ai is a very promising AI tool with the option to use GPT-4 for free. While the free version of Perplexity doesn't specifically state that you're using GPT-4, toggling its "Copilot" mode gives you access to GPT-4, albeit limited to five questions every four hours.

 Overall, it's not a bad option and gives you a taste of what Perplexity.ai is all about. If OpenAI is pushing towards creating artificial general intelligence, Perplexity.ai seems to be pushing towards reinventing internet search, and its tool is a great option for those who want a turbo-charged search experience.

 Upgrading to Perplexity.ai's Pro tier will set you back $20 per month (the same as a ChatGPT Plus subscription), but does mean you can ask more than 300 Copilot-powered questions,[use Anthropic's Claude 3 model](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-3/) , and upload as many files as you want to for AI analysis.

![merlin ai extension free gpt4 access](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/merlin-ai-extension-free-gpt4-access.jpg)

 Merlin is a handy Chrome browser extension that provides GPT-4 access for free, albeit limited to a specific number of daily queries.

 What makes Merlin a great way to use GPT-4 for free are its requests. As a Merlin Free user, you receive 102 requests per day. Each GPT-4 request made will set you back 30 requests, giving you around three free GPT-4 questions per day (which is roughly in line with most other free GPT-4 tools). Merlin also has the option to access the web for your requests, though this adds a 2x multiplier (60 requests rather than 30).

![merlin chrome extension integrated into x social media account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/merlin-chrome-extension-integrated-into-x-social-media-account.jpg)

 However, GPT-3.5 requests are much cheaper, at one request per question, and you can also integrate Merlin into your social media accounts if required.

![using gpt-4 on hugging face](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/using-gpt-4-on-hugging-face.jpg)

 Hugging Face is an open-source machine learning and AI development website where thousands of developers collaborate and build tools.

 I've had mixed success with GPT-4 access models on Hugging Face. Several Hugging Face Spaces claim to give access to GPT-4, but they either take too long to answer a question to be reliable or are so limited by the small amount of processing power available to the Hugging Face free account that it's not worth using.

 However, I've included the option here in case you find more joy than I did. The image above shows one Space that processed my request instantly (as its daily API access limit hadn't yet been hit), while another requires you to[enter your ChatGPT API key](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-api-complete-guide/) .

## Formerly Had Free GPT-4 Access: Poe by Quora, Ora, Forefront, Nat.dev

 Several other tools once provided free GPT-4 access but have since removed the option or pushed it into a premium or subscription tier. The reason for that is simple enough: it's expensive to integrate GPT-4 access into a site and give that access away for free, especially as many people want to access GPT-4 for free.

### [Poe](https://poe.com/)

![poe homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-ain-page.jpg)

 Poe is a generative AI tool that gives you access to several LLMs and AI chatbots in one place. Unlike most of the major generative AI tools that feature just one option, Poe, developed by Quora, helps you spread your questions around, choosing the best option for the job when required.

 Quora CEO[Adam D'Angelo's tweet](https://twitter.com/adamdangelo/status/1635690637990445057?) initially revealed Poe's GPT-4 integration in March 2023, with users able to send one free GPT-4 message per day. The number of free GPT-4 messages rose to three, but it has since removed its free GPT-4 messaging capacity. There is no indication if Poe will restore its free GPT-4 messaging option, but it's worth keeping tabs on, just in case.

### [Ora](https://ora.ai/dashboard)

![ora ai tool home page with llm options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ora-ai-tool-home-page-with-llm-options.jpg)

 Ora is a fun and friendly AI tool that allows you to create a "one-click chatbot" for integration elsewhere. Say you wanted to integrate an AI chatbot into your website but don't know how; Ora is the tool you turn to.

 Ora has since moved GPT-4 access into its Hobby or Pro Plan, starting from $25 monthly.

![forefront ai chatgpt prompt output](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forefront-ai-chatgpt-prompt-output.jpg)

 Forefront is another multi-access AI tool featuring free access to GPT-3.5, Forefront's in-house tool, and Claude-Instant 1.2\. When it first launched, Forefront provided a limited number of free GPT-4 requests (along with Claude 2), but this access has since been removed.

### [Nat.dev](https://nat.dev/)

![open playground nat dev credits top up request](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/open-playground-nat-dev-credits-top-up-request.jpg)

 Nat.dev is an Open Playground tool that offered limited access to GPT-4\. However, the person behind nat.dev eventually restricted free access to GPT-4, as costs spiraled. However, you can still use nat.dev to access a wide range of free LLMs, such as Llama, Mistral, and so on.

## How Much Does Full GPT-4 Access Cost?

 If you want the full GPT-4 experience, a ChatGPT Plus subscription is what you need. Sure, it costs $20, but the range of tools, speed and quality of response, and new functionality added make it a worthwhile investment, even for casual users. However, for those who only want to ask one or two questions every now and then, one of the free GPT-4 tools above will do the job just fine.

## No Real ChatGPT Client Exists for Windows; Don't Fall Victim to Malware-Disguised Alternatives

 OpenAI's ChatGPT generative AI is being used for all manner of enterprising activities. But as with anything that rapidly gains popularity, it doesn't take long before criminals try and use it to their advantage.Enter the ChatGPT Windows desktop client, a supposed full desktop client for ChatGPT that runs on Windows 10 and Windows 11.However, as good as a desktop ChatGPT client sounds, you shouldn't trust any download links or adverts for such a tool because it doesn't currently exist.

## ChatGPT Desktop Client Is Actually Trojan Malware

 In February 2023, cybersecurity firm[Kaspersky reported](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2022340/https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/chatgpt-stealer-win-client/47274/) that it had uncovered a malware campaign using ChatGPT as its lure, promising victims a free ChatGPT account with a $50 balance (to spend on[the premium version of ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-paid-chatgpt-professional-is-inevitable/) ) and the use of a new ChatGPT desktop client.

 Unfortunately, it's all a falsehood. The campaign uses fake accounts mimicking OpenAI or ChatGPT spread across several different social networks, including Twitter and Telegram, advertising access to a new ChatGPT trial.

 Once the user clicks the link, it transports them to a page that looks exactly like the official ChatGPT site, albeit with the addition of a**Download For Windows** button. As you can probably guess, when you click the download button, you don't receive a new trial version of a ChatGPT desktop client. Below you can see the real site, followed by the fake ChatGPT site.

> If this archive is unpacked and the executable file run, then, depending on the version of Windows, the user sees either a message saying installation failed for some reason, or no message at all â€” at which point the process seems to end.

 But the lack of a message or the Windows warning that your installation failed is just indicating that the ChatGPT malware was successfully installed.

 According to Kaspersky's research, the ChatGPT desktop client malware has been spotted across Asia, Africa, Europe, and America.

### 3 Ways to Avoid ChatGPT Scams

1. First up, make sure you're using the official ChatGPT website, and double-check the actual URL before signing up, adding your credentials, and so on:[https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) or[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) .
2. Double-check any social media accounts against OpenAI's official accounts. For example, on Twitter,[OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI) is the only account you should trust for official ChatGPT product releases and launches.
3. Make sure your antivirus software is up to date, and consider installing an additional[security tool like Malwarebytes Premium](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-upgrade-malwarebytes-premium/) to mop up any other nasties.

## Avoid Anything Claiming to Be a ChatGPT Client

 For now, there is no ChatGPT desktop client. ChatGPT is only available through your browser, and for the time being, that's how the situation will stay.

 Check-in with the official OpenAI account from time to time for ChatGPT news, but otherwise, if you see a post claiming to offer a trial account for a new ChatGPT product, give it a wide berth and report it to whatever platform you see it on.

Though you can directly play M2TS MTS videos on Mac with some other players, we still suggest you to free convert MTS/M2TS for playing on Mac. That's because playing back AVCHD video directly upon your Mac comes to be a hard job for your computer's CPU and graphics card; AVCHD recorded videos are usually in big size, resolution over 1920\*1080; and even some camcorder recordings are recorded in interlaced scanning, causing the image you see from AVCHD video will not be true to the original. But if you ultilze the free MacX Video Converter to [free convert MTS/M2TS on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you will enjoy a better video effect on your Macbook Pro/Air, Mac mini, iMac 5K etc.

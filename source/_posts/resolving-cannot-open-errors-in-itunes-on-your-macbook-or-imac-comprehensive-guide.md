## Why and How to Fix iTunes If It Won't Open on Mac 

Generally, the iTunes not opening error occurs probably because your Mac computer is **installing an update to iTunes**. You cannot open iTunes unless the process is finished. Sometimes the update has been taking longer than expected, this can be as a result of the unstable network connectivity and the huge size of the update being installed. You can just keep track of the progress in the Mac app store under Updates. Or open iTunes while holding shift on your keyboard, then test to see if it is still telling you that it's updating.

Additionally, **[updating to new macOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)** also probably leads to bad compatibility with your current iTunes version, thereafter causing iTunes not opening or launching error. Sometimes, iTunes fails to launch/load/open on Mac and becomes unresponsive out of a **third-party plug-in or script** problem. Still, sometimes you cannot open your iTunes simply because your [iPhone cannot be recognized by iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), or some[unknown 0xE errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). To fix the issues, you can follow the solutions below. To move on the steps below, make sure the iPhone or iPad is connected to your Mac securely. 

**Step 1: Quit iTunes.** Before you are going to open iTunes app, make sure it is not running. If you see iTunes in the menu bar at the upper left when you try to open iTunes app on Mac, press Commad+Q or click iTunes > Quit iTunes. If you cannot do that, open Activity Monitor > select iTunes with a left click if you see iTunes running, use the X inside of an octagon in the upper left of the Activity Monitor app to close it.

**Step 2:** Restart your Mac. Sometimes, a simple Mac restarting will fix the iTunes not opening error. To do this, please click Apple menu > click Restart to restart your Mac. 

**Step 3:** Launch iTunes on Mac in safe mode. According to Apple, a third-party plug-in or script might be the culprit to iTunes not opening error on Mac.

Here are the steps about how to open iTunes on Mac in safe mode:

 Hold down Command+Option keys when launching iTunes. This will load iTunes in safe mode with a message saying "iTunes is running in safe mode. Visual plug-ins you have installed have been temporarily disabled." Click Continue. If the iTunes is back to work and opens on Mac, this means a third-party iTunes add-on is causing this error.

**Step 4:** Uninstall iTunes. If you're unable to launch iTunes after testing in safe mode, uninstall iTunes software.

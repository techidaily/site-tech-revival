### Convert ibooks drm epub to pdf

 Sorry to tell you that the above-mentioned software couldn't help you remove drm if your books are bought from ibookstore. We all know that books purchased from ibookstore are protected by its unique Apple Fairplay DRM. So how to deal with the ibooks drm epub if you want to convert them to pdf and then read them on other popular devices except the iOS devices? After searching the Internet, finally I do find a tool, named Requiem, which can remove ibooks drm. You can have a try.

**Step 1:** Install [iBooks DRM Removal](http://download.epubor.com/sold/ibooksdrmremoval/requiem-4.1-mac.zip). And then launch it to follow instructions to remove the Apple Fairplay DRM.

**Helpful tips:** This tool only works with iTunes 10.5/10.6, and the version after Requiem 3.3.6 even delete the iBooks decryption feature. It doesn't work with iTunes 11.0.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.8\. It seems a little complicated for you to deal with ibooks drm, so I suggest you to think twice before deciding to purchase books from ibookstore.

**Step 2:** After successfully remove drm from ibooks epub, you can still apply this metioned tool ultimate converter to continue your job converting drm free epub to pdf. It will save you a lot of trouble if your epub books are drm free.

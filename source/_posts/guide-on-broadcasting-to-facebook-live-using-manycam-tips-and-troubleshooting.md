### How to stream to Facebook groups

1) Open your group’s page, click **More**, select **Edit group settings**,

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FBG_1.png)2) Scroll down to the **Apps** section, click **Add Apps**,

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FBG_3.png)  
3) In the search field, type-in **ManyCam**, and add it from the search results. On the next step click **Add**.

### How to stream to several Facebook profiles (pages, groups) simultaneously (RTMP)

This includes Facebook profiles, pages, groups, and events that you manage.

1. Create a Live event and a custom RTMP server to stream to another page as [described above](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/),
2. Start streaming to one page as per instructions above,
3. Start streaming to a custom RTMP server.

Live events for Facebook Pages (e.g. Business Page, Fan Page) can be created from Publishing Tools. Please refer to the [Facebook Live guide.](https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/get-started/live)

**TL;DR**

1. Create a live event,
2. Create an RTMP server in ManyCam using the stream URL and key from Facebook,
3. Click Preview on Facebook,
4. Start Streaming from ManyCam,
5. Wait for stream and then go Live to publish the event,

**Facebook requirements:**

* Maximum supported resolution is 1080p (1920 x 1080)
* Recommended FPS value is 30 frames per second
* Recommended max bit rate is 4000 Kbps.

Please note that unless you are using a persistent stream key, you will need to use new stream key for each live event you create. Please refer to [the Facebook guide](https://www.facebook.com/help/587160588142067?helpref=faq%5Fcontent) for more information.

I'm getting a message saying '**Unable to start broadcasting to...'**

Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot this:

1. Check your RTMP server settings, you might have entered incorrect server address,
2. Go to ManyCam Settings -> Network and make sure “Proxy” is disabled,
3. Check your firewall settings,
4. Check if any other software installed on your machine blocks ManyCam,
5. Make sure your Network Connection is on.

## Can You Build a Sustainable Career with AI Prompt Engineering? Let's Dive In

 AI prompt engineering has become one of the hottest jobs in the market. But is it a stable career path or just a short-lived hype? If you're interested in becoming an AI prompt engineer, read on, and learn about AI prompt engineering as an occupation.

## What is AI Prompt Engineering?

![A ChatGPT Conversation About New York on Mobile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-mobile-conversation.jpg)

 AI prompt engineering is the process of creating and refining prompts for artificial intelligence systems. The input, or what you tell the AI model to do, is what you call the prompt.

 Generative AI, like ChatGPT, predicts words in sequence. The technology is trained on a large data set to churn out the best probable word sequence after being given a prompt.

 Xavier Amatrain, VP of Engineering at LinkedIn, says in[LinkedIn's Prompt Engineering 101](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prompt-engineering-101-introduction-resources-amatriain/) that a prompt contains four elements. Here are examples of each element:

1. **Instructions** : "Give 20 inspiring quotes for a career coach's Instagram page."
2. **Question** : "What is a content strategy?"
3. **Input Data** : "Here is some information about a career coach: \[input information\]." Then add an instruction like, "Create a content strategy for her business."
4. **Examples** : "I love the following books as a career coach: \[give examples of books\]." Then add a question like, "What other books should I read?"

 Your prompt could range from simple to complex. A simple prompt could be a question that needs a factual response like, "Who was the President of the United States in 2018?" A more complex prompt could combine any of the four elements:

 "\[Instruction\] Act as a digital marketing specialist. You are asked to run a social media campaign on Instagram to grow a career coaching business. \[Input data\] The career coach is a woman in her 40s who was a teacher for 20 years. She successfully transitioned from education to the IT industry. She is now a successful entrepreneur with an MBA from a top university in the U.S. Her goal is to help teachers in the U.S. successfully transition to a different career. She also authored the book 'Career Transitions in Mid-Life.' \[Instruction\] Create a content strategy for her business."

## What Does an AI Prompt Engineer Do?

![binary code background showing a woman face to face with a robot ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/muo-photo-standard-10-2.jpg)

 As an AI prompt engineer or "AI whisperer," your task is to develop a set of inputs that an AI model can use to generate the most desirable output. As we have seen, the prompt's quality significantly affects an AI model's performance.

 To help an AI system give the most accurate responses to problems, AI prompt engineers train the AI with prompts. They design prompts to get the best results. As an AI Prompt Engineer, you should be able to understand the problem and select the best data sources to do these tasks.

## Applications of AI Prompt Engineering

![online conversation with a customer service AI chatbot ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/muo-photo-standard-11-2.jpg)

 AI prompt engineering creates more accurate and efficient language models that help people work efficiently. It's a legitimate career that helps develop the most[impressive web apps you can try right now](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ai-web-apps/) .

 You can train AI bots as Anna Bernstein does with Copy.ai, as shared with[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-write-better-ai-chatgpt-prompts-according-prompt-engineer-2023-3) . Riley Goodside has a similar job with Scale AI, as mentioned in[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/25/prompt-engineers-techs-next-big-job/) . Here are some other ways other users have used AI prompt engineering:

1. **Create chatbots** : You can create conversational chatbots for customer support on social media or websites. For instance, Amogh Agastya shares how he was able to[integrate Dialogflow with GPT-3 to create a mental health assistant from scratch](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-integrate-dialogflow-with-gpt-3-creating-a-personal-virtual-mental-health-assistant-from-fee7d363993a) .
2. **Improve recommendation systems** : You can improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations in a platform, as seen in this post about[The Quest for Better Music Recommendations Through ChatGPT Prompt Engineering](https://hackernoon.com/ai-prompts-are-the-incantations-that-make-chatgpt-do-magical-things) .
3. **Develop extensions** : You can create Google Chrome extensions like Igor Stefurak, as featured on[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-i-built-chrome-extension-sold-acquire-thousands-2023-4) . Stefurak, an entrepreneur, built his extension in ten hours using ChatGPT. He then sold it for thousands on Acquire.

 There are multiple[practical uses of ChatGPT in Programming](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-programming-practical-uses/) and other[creative ways to use ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/) . But generating successful results requires knowledge of AI prompt engineering.

## Is AI Prompt Engineering a Stable Career Path?

 Is an AI prompt engineering career stable? Will it give you room for career growth, and will it last forever? Given the speed by which AI and other tech are developing (plus volatile economic conditions), no job is truly stable. However, the best time to learn AI prompt engineering is now, while the technology is relatively new, and the profession isn't saturated with "experts."

 As Simon Willison, a developer and researcher, tells[CBC Radio](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/prompt-engineer-artificial-intelligence-1.6781078) , companies are seeking out experts in communicating with AI. This shows that while anyone can create prompts and use AI for daily tasks, there's also space for expertise.

 Moreover, a simple search online shows that companies are hiring prompt engineers. You can check out job posts from the[Boston Children's Hospital](https://jobs.bostonchildrens.org/job/17785868/ai-prompt-engineer-idha-boston-ma/) and the AI safety and research company[Anthropic](https://jobs.lever.co/Anthropic/e3cde481-d446-460f-b576-93cab67bd1ed) .

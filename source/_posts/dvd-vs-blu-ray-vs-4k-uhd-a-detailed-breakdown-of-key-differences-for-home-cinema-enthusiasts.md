What's the differences between **Blu-ray vs DVD vs 4K UHD**? Simply put, in Blu ray versus DVD comparison, Blu ray discs excel most DVDs in the aspect of image quality. As for standard DVDs, most of them have a a standard definition resolution of 480 or enhanced definition resolution of 520\. This quality will give enough clear image on standard TV if you sit far enough. But movies on standard DVD may look grainy on the HDTV. That's why why Blu ray is better than DVD in a way. The HD DVD, which supports up to 1080P resolutions, will primarily compete with Blu-ray discs. 

## Software Recommendation: MacX DVD Ripper Pro

## 1\. Quality and Resolution

[**Blu-ray discs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray) can host up to 1080p resolution (1920×1080 pixels), at up to 60 (59.94) frame rate. Compare Blu ray and DVD, the former is more suitable for the HDTV display. However, when Blu ray disc vs HD DVD, the similar resolution and same media encoding method will result in equivalent visual quality, which means we can hardly tell the difference between Blu ray and HD DVD if we are not sitting pretty close to the TV or the TV is not that big. But you should note that HD DVD is now officially discontinued. 

Speaking of resolution, [**4K UHD**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) will fully deserve to be the winner in the 4K vs Blu ray vs DVD battle. The biggest difference is that 4K supports resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 (4K), while others cap out at 1920 x 1080 (1080p). This significant difference however seems to be surprisingly subtle for human eyes. To sum up, in the quality round of Blu ray vs DVD vs 4K Ultra HD, **4K is 4 times better than Blu ray, while Bluray is 6 times higher than DVD**.

## 2\. Storage

Storage means that how much data can the format hold. A standard [DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can host about 4.7 GB of data, about two hours of movie. This kind of DVD is referred as DVD 5, while the dual layer DVD, referred as DVD 9 compared with DVD 5, can host twice the amount of data to about **8.5 - 8.7 GB**. Accordingly, a dual layer DVD can host four hours of movie. How about Blu ray versus DVD? 

Compared to DVD, Blu-ray disc means five to ten times increase in storage. Indeed, there are Blu ray advantages over DVD in capacity: Bluray disc have 25GB on single layer and **50GB** on dual layers. This is a significant increase, even in Blu ray vs HD DVD, which hold 15 GB and 30GB on single and double layers respectively. 

So which will win in DVD vs Blu ray vs 4K Ultra HD? In fact, the **Ultra HD 4K can hold between 66 to 100GB of data**, far surpassing HD DVD or Blu ray. Compared to MPEG-2, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC used in Bluray and DVD, 4K codecs H.265, VP9 and AV1 provide better compression efficiency, 50% smaller in size.

Put aside numerous DVD movies, some outstanding titles in Bluray include The Wizard of Oz, Avatar, Gravity - Diamond Luxe Edition, Iron Man 3, The Dark Knight Rises and more.

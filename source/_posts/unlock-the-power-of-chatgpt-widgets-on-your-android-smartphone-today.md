## How ChatGPT on Android Compares to Other Versions

 Assuming that you already know[how to use ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai) , you're no doubt wondering how the Android version stacks up against other versions. I'm happy to tell you that if you want to use ChatGPT only on mobile, it works splendidly. In fact, it's probably going to become your preferred method of using ChatGPT. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, using ChatGPT on mobile is probably the best way to use the AI chatbot.

 It feels fast, slick, and like it was designed with a mobile-first mindset. If you have used the iOS version of ChatGPT, then you already know what to expect. Just as it felt right at home in Apple's ecosystem, so too does it feel at home on Android. And because navigating and learning the in's and out's of the app only takes a few moments, you'll be asking questions and getting AI-generated answers in no time.

 Do keep in mind that, as of July 2023, not every feature is available on Android. For example, ChatGPT Plus was not available upon release. When it's available, it will be available for Premium subscribers as always. As for the perks? You can easily read your entire ChatGPT history (regardless of the platform you've used it on) and control the data of your account. You can even export the data to your device with a single tap.

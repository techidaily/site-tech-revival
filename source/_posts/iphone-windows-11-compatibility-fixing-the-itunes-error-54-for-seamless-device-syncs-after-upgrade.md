## IPhone-Windows 11 Compatibility: Fixing the iTunes Error -54 for Seamless Device Syncs After Upgrade

This can happen if a file on your computer or iPhone is locked. In most case, you will be able to sync after you click the**OK**button at the bottom of the message.   
  
If the sync still won’t happen, don’t worry, this is an easy question to solve.   
  
Before we begin, please make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer and that your iPhone is already updated to the latest version.

## 1.[DAIR.AI](https://discord.com/invite/SKgkVT8BGJ)

![Discord Channel for DAIR AI Users](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/discord-ai-channel-dair.jpg)

[DAIR.AI](https://dair.ai/) primarily engages with the community through Discord. It provides free, comprehensive resources on various AI topics, such as prompt engineering, machine learning, and career building. You’ll also find pieces answering general knowledge questions.

 Considering the server’s diverse resources, you’ll find it helpful regardless of your current understanding of AI. Just introduce yourself and your intentions. Moderators and members might help you navigate the multiple channels available.

 Also, explore the DAIR.AI website. You’ll have trouble following conversations otherwise—most server members discuss its resources and GitHub repositories.

## 2.[GitHub](https://github.com/)

![ChatGPT Prompts Repositories on GitHub](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/github-repositories-for-chatgpt.jpg)

 Anyone interested in AI should sign up for GitHub. It’s a paid source code-hosting site that lets users collaborate on coding and programming projects. You and your partners can take codes straight from repositories.

 Likewise, GitHub accommodates newbies. You can scroll through repositories and study resources with a free account. Find any topic you want. Just note that you’ll have limited collaborative freedom until you upgrade your membership.

 Let’s say you’re interested in ChatGPT. While you can’t train LLMs with other users, you can search for[effective ChatGPT prompts on GitHub](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-prompts-on-github/) .

## 3.[r/ChatGPTJailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTJailbreak/)

![ChatGPT Jailbreak Prompts on Reddit Communities](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/reddit-community-for-chatgpt-prompts.jpg)

 ChatGPT has less rigid restrictions than other chatbots. For instance, Bing Chat automatically terminates conversations that go against its guidelines, while ChatGPT still responds. You can generate different outputs by rephrasing your prompts.

 The below image shows ChatGPT rejecting a request to portray a manga character.

![ChatGPT Refusing to Act Like Tomie Character](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-rejecting-roleplay-request-1.jpg)

 After rephrasing the instructions and adding more details, it quickly obliged.

![ChatGPT Accepts Roleplay Request and Starts Acting Like Tomie](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-accepts-roleplay-request-as-tomie.jpg)

 You can apply this trick to other prompts. On r/ChatGPTJailbreak, you’ll learn the proper phrasing, language, word choice, and sentence structure when jailbreaking ChatGPT. Only specific formulas can bypass AI restrictions.

## 4.[ChatGPT Prompt Engineers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/706382050894862/)

![A Facebook Group for Sharing and Posting ChatGPT Prompts ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-group-chatgpt-prompt-engineers.jpg)

 ChatGPT Prompt Engineers is a decent community for beginners. Members just typically ask general knowledge questions about writing prompts and getting optimal outputs. You won’t have trouble keeping up with discussions.

 We also like that the moderators proactively weed out spam marketers and shady ads. Many[crooks abuse ChatGPT to execute cyberattacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-cybersecurity-threat/) nowadays. Even tech-savvy individuals could fall victim to them if they’re not careful. So minimize your exposure to scams altogether.

## 5.[Midjourney Prompt Tricks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1192421464638601)

![A Facebook Group for Sharing Midjourney Prompts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/midjourney-prompts-facebook-group.jpg)

 Midjourney ranks among the[most popular text-to-art generators online](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) . Its sophisticated AI architecture was trained on much broader datasets, allowing it to generate more realistic elements.

 With that said, utilizing Midjourney is also challenging. It requires more technical and precise prompts than other AI art generators. Many newbies can only write basic prompts.

 To craft better text-to-image prompts, join the Midjourney Prompt Tricks Facebook group. Users trade prompts here. Take inspiration from workflows that match your art style; you don’t have to waste time writing prompts from scratch.

 Try some[AI art prompt tricks](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-art-prompt-ideas/) to get your creative juices flowing. See how phrasing affects the way your output. You’ll notice specific phrases and keywords that trigger different image elements.

## 6.[r/PromptDesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/)

![A Reddit Community for Sharing Prompt Design Tricks](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/reddit-community-prompt-design.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 r/PromptDesign is a good place to master prompt engineering. Instead of sharing model-specific prompts, the group discusses ways users communicate with AI tools. Its members test various platforms regularly.

 Note that this subreddit covers relatively advanced topics compared to other groups. The members don’t just share prompts. Expect most techniques, tools, and methods discussed to have steep learning curves.

## 7.[r/OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/)

![Reddit Community for OpenAI Users](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/openai-reddit-community.jpg)

 Most users know OpenAI for ChatGPT and Dall-E, but it actually carries various AI tools. They primarily cater to developers. Professionals use them to integrate LLMs into their systems or build AI-driven applications.

 AI development requires much A/B testing. If you need support during the process, join r/OpenAI. It’s a subreddit for discussing members’ experiences with programming and building AI apps on OpenAI. It goes beyond the site’s non-API products.

 Most topics can get pretty technical. We suggest filtering the posts based on flair so that you can focus on one aspect of OpenAI at a time.

## 8.[r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/)

![Reddit Community for Stable Diffusion Prompts and Output](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stablediffusion-prompts-on-reddit.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 r/StableDiffusion is the largest subreddit dedicated to Stable Diffusion. The community allows sharing workflows. However, it primarily encourages users to post outputs and discuss relevant AI news—prompt engineering is merely a part of generating AI art.

 The group might be helpful if you prefer Stable Diffusion over Midjourney and Dall-E models. Study the system’s limits and capabilities. Users post various media forms, including 3D images, 2D portraits, and animations.

 Meanwhile, artists who prefer other text-to-image models could use the group for comparisons. See which system provides the best outputs. You might even find Stable Diffusion users testing your preferred art styles frequently.

## 9.[Sales, Marketing, Social Media, Artificial Intelligence (AI), ChatGPT Technology Innovation Network](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/54066/)

![LinkedIn Group to Share AI Tips for Salespeople and Marketers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/linkedin-ai-group.jpg)

 It’s currently the largest AI community on LinkedIn. The group has around a million members worldwide, many of whom post regularly. It gets status updates every few minutes.

 As its name suggests, the community focuses on the applications of AI in sales, marketing, and social media ads. Most just share prompts. But you’ll also find engaging discussions about[automating work tasks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tasks-freelancers-should-automate/) , like lead generation, appointment setting, and client management.

 The admins are relatively active. Every few weeks, they upload relevant resources, like websites, PDFs, and tools. You can also connect with them for queries. Just don’t expect an immediate response unless you already have mutuals.

 Perhaps the only downside is the group gets plenty of spam. You might have to scroll through aggressive ads and campaigns before finding valuable content.

## What is screen resolution

 The screen resolution or display resolution determines the clarity and number of items displayed on your computer screen. It’s measured horizontally and vertically in pixels. At lower screen resolutions, such as 800 x 600, texts and images appear larger but less items fit on the screen. At higher resolutions, such as 1920 x 1080, more items fit on the screen, with smaller and sharper appearances.

## Bonus tip: How to fix screen resolution issues

 Missing or outdated graphics card and monitor drivers may also affect your screen resolution. You should always keep your graphics card and monitor drivers up to date.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics card and monitor drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics card and monitor drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

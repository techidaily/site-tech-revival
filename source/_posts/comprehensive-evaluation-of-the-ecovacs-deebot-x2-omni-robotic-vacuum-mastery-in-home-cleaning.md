### Key Takeaways

* The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni is a high-end robot vacuum that offers more than just vacuuming. It has features such as mopping, a self-emptying dust bag, and self-cleaning mop pads.
* The square design of the Deebot X2 Omni allows it to get into corners better than other robot vacuums, thanks to its rotating sweeping brush and wide roller brush.
* The X2 Omni can map your home, vacuum with powerful suction, mop with automatically raised and lowered mopping pads, and it has impressive self-cleaning capabilities. However, it comes with a high price tag.

 Many robot vacuums literally just vacuum, but some can do a whole lot more. The [Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CDPJ2C94?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000509&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is one such robot. It vacuums, mops, monitors your home, and cleans itself. The promises are as big as the price tag.

 I don't have much experience with robot vacuums, so starting with the Deebot X2 Omni was like jumping directly into the deep end of a pool. This thing is big, and it has an almost overwhelming number of features and settings. I quickly realized this is not a standard robot vacuum, and the $1,500 price tag reflects that.

 As a newbie to robot vacuums, I was most curious about whether the Deebot X2 Omini could realistically replace my manual vacuum. People I know with robot vacuums always seem to still do some level of vacuuming themselves. But if I'm dropping close to $2K on a robot, it better not need much help. Let's put it to the test.

 My first thought when I saw the Deebot X2 Omni's box was, "Whoa, surely it can't be _this_ big." I proceeded to open the box and remove the packaging to discover that it was indeed quite large. Turns out a robot that can vacuum, mop, empty its own dust bag, wash its own mops, and dry itself requires a large docking station.

 The robot itself is surprisingly small for all that's on board. It's about the same size as the Roborock S8, but with one major difference: the X2 Omni is square. The square design allows the Deebot to get into corners much, much better than the more common puck-shaped vacuums.

![Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni on carpet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/ecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-9.png) 

Joe Fedewa / How-To Geek

 The robot and docking station are mostly made of plastic, which is more apparent by looking than by feeling. Both the robot and the station felt well-made, heavy, and durable, but aesthetically, it was not much to look at. The smooth flat, silver-ish top panel on the Deebot reminds me of an old Samsung Galaxy phone. Design-wise, the X2 Omni is a step down from the [X1 Omni](https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-X1-Self-Empty-Auto-Clean-Navigation/dp/B09NPKWDRX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000509&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate).

 One last note on appearance. The X2 Omni is available in black and white, and I would recommend getting the white model if you have white trim in your home. I noticed the black model left some slight smudges on a white bookcase in my house. The marks were not hard to remove, but it's something to keep in mind.

##  Deebot X2 Omni Features: What Can't It Do?

 Let's get into the details of what this robot ~~vacuum~~ home manager can do. As mentioned, it can vacuum and mop, and it can clean itself after doing both of those operations. But is this a "jack of all trades, master of none" situation?

###  Mapping

![Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni cameras and sensors.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/ecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-10.png)

Joe Fedewa / How-To Geek

 The first thing you'll need to do before cleaning is let the X2 Omni map your home. As you might expect from a robot that costs $1,500, there are a lot of sensors built-in to help create an accurate map. It uses an RGBD sensor for color and depth, as well as a dual-laser [LiDAR sensor](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/exploring-new-horizons-video-resources-for-dynamic-learning-spaces-for-2024/).

 Unlike other robot vacuums, the X2 Omni does the initial mapping of your home without actually vacuuming. This makes the mapping process go much quicker. The robot attempts to identify furniture and place it on the map, but I found this to be pretty hit-or-miss. It was decent at identifying the type of furniture, but it weirdly placed the things in the wrong orientation often. Thankfully, you can manually edit and add furniture.

 Of course, you don't have to do that if you don't want to. The X2 Omni will automatically navigate around whatever you have in your home. However, it's helpful if you take advantage of the built-in voice assistant, which allows you to say commands such as "clean around the table."

 You can save up to three maps to the X2 Omni, which is good for multi-level homes. I was able to map my first and second stories without any issues, and you don't need a docking station on every level. All in all, I was pretty happy with the mapping capabilities.

###  Vacuuming

 The X2 Omni can do more than just vacuum, but vacuuming is most likely the thing it will do the most. It has four vacuum power settings to choose from, with a max of 8,000 Pa. The suction power is very evident by the volume of the vacuum. Most robot vacuums I've heard are relatively quiet, but the X2 Omni sounded like a full-size manual vacuum.

 I was mostly happy with the vacuuming capabilities of the X2 Omni. Occasionally, even with the max vacuum power mode enabled, I would find small things here and there that didn't get picked up. Sometimes, little clumps of fuzz would fall off the roller and not get picked up. The good news is that none of this happened every time. For the most part, my carpet looks clean and freshly vacuumed. Since I've had the X2 Omni in my home, I haven't felt the need to use my manual vacuum.

 The square design is partially to thank for this as well. Unlike puck-shaped vacuums, the X2 Omni can actually get into corners. And it doesn't just rely on suction to pick stuff up. A rotating sweeping brush on the front right corner and a wide 7.8-inch roller brush underneath helps with this.

 The one downside to using the maximum vacuum power is battery life. The X2 Omni needs to stop and recharge considerably more often if you crank up the suction. At max power, it needed to stop three or four times to recharge to cover around 600sq ft. Of course, this all happens without your involvement, so it's not really a big deal. Just something to keep in mind if you want to get your home cleaned in a short amount of time.

###  Mopping

Close 

 As I've mentioned multiple times, the X2 Omni is not a one-trick pony. This robot vacuum is also a robot mop, and this is where you'll find one of the biggest upgrades from the X1 Omni.

 The X2 Omni is equipped with two spinning mopping pads on the rear of the robot. These mopping pads are made of chenille, and they are automatically lifted and lowered when moving between carpet and hard surfaces. Previous models required manually taking the mopping pads on and off, but that's no longer something you have to worry about. A huge upgrade.

 I was much more skeptical about the mopping capabilities than the vacuuming. Whenever I mop my floors, I feel like I have to put some elbow grease into scrubbing tough spots. I didn't think rotating pads could match that, and I was right. Fabric mopping pads—robotic or human-powered—won't be able to get tough spots that need scrubbing.

 In general, I was pleased with how my floors looked. I hate mopping more than vacuuming, and I feel comfortable letting the X2 Omni take over for me. The docking station has two \~1-gallon removable tanks for clean and dirty water. The water is heated up to 131F for mopping and cleaning the mops. I recommend adding a mopping solution to the clean water tank. It improved the results (and made things smell nice).

###  Self Cleaning

Close 

 All of these cleaning capabilities wouldn't be nearly as exciting if it were a pain to clean the robot itself. Thankfully, the self-cleaning features are almost as impressive. The X2 Omni can empty its own dust bag and wash and dry the mopping pads.

 When the onboard dust collection needs to be emptied, the robot simply goes back to the docking station, and the contents are sucked out. The robot will also routinely go back to have the mops washed, and when mopping is completely done, it uses hot air to dry the mops. That's particularly important to keep the mopping pads from getting musty and gross over time.

 I think this is where the X2 Omni impressed me the most. There's really not much you have to do to take care of the robot. The most "labor-intensive" thing I had to do was empty and refill the water tanks twice in two weeks. But it's not up to you to stay on top of the maintenance. The companion app lets you know when the tanks need to be refilled, the dust bag needs emptying, or any of the brushes, rollers, and filters need to be replaced.

###  Voice Assistant

 I'll be honest, I didn't want to use yet another digital voice assistant, but the features of "Yiko" (pronounced "eco") sounded pretty compelling—and I couldn't get the Google Assistant integration to work.

 Yiko can handle essentially anything you might do from the app and more. For example, it's easy to say "OK Yiko, clean the living room." More impressively, you can say, "OK Yiko, come clean here," and it will find you and clean your area. You can also launch custom cleaning routines with voice commands. It's pretty cool.

 I eventually realized there's an advantage to a voice assistant like Yiko over Google Assistant or Alexa. Yiko is designed specifically for the X2 Omni, so that's all it knows. It's more straightforward to get what you need from Yiko than it would be to try to do the same things through Google Assistant or Alexa.

##  Deebot X2 Omni App: A Lot to Explore

 The Yiko voice assistant can be very handy, but you're probably going to use the Ecovacs Home app a lot as well. The good news is it's a pretty solid app, but it has _a lot_ going on.

 The app has many of the features you'd expect to find for a robot vacuum. It allows you to create zones to keep the robot out of, assign names to rooms, customize the layout of your home after mapping, create specialized cleaning routines, see cleaning reports, watch where the robot is on the map, and do a whole lot of customizing.

 I can't stress enough how much tweaking you can do with the app. There are multiple modes for vacuuming and mopping that you can try out to dial in your cleaning preferences. For example, to be more thorough, you can have the mopping done in an S-shaped pattern. You can also decide how mopping and vacuuming work together. Should the robot switch back and forth as it moves around or save the mopping for the end? It's all up to you.

 One fun feature is the ability to look through the robot's front camera. Not only is it just plain cool to see what your robot cleaner is looking at, but it can actually be helpful if it gets stuck somewhere. I was able to get the robot unstuck from outside my home just by looking through the camera, pausing it, and sending it back to the station, back and forth until it wiggled free.

 All in all, it's a fine app, but the number of options and features may be overwhelming to some. You'll want to spend some time exploring the app and dialing in your cleaning routine over time.

##  Should You Buy the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni?

 Overall, I'm very impressed with the [Deebot X2 Omni](http://amazon.com/dp/B0CDPJ2C94?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000509&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). I genuinely feel like it can replace the vast majority of my manual vacuuming and mopping. My house has felt cleaner since I've been living with it, and I greatly appreciate that. It's a big thing that I don't have to think about anymore.

 As a reviewer, it's sometimes easy to be impressed by a product and tell people they should buy it when you have the luxury of trying it out for free. Before this, I can't say I would have been willing to spend $1,500 on a robot vacuum. After actually living with it for a couple of weeks, I can see where an argument could be made. What price would you put on never having to vacuum or mop the floors in your house again? How much is all that saved time worth to you?

 Ultimately, you're either in the market for a high-end robot cleaner, or you're not. There are other options in this category of vacuum/mop robots. The [Roborock S8 Pro Ultra](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BVB5PTDK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000509&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) costs $1,600, and the [Roomba Combo j9+](https://amazon.com/dp/B0C415HQPX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000509&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecovacs-deebot-x2-omni-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is $1,400\. So, if you want these capabilities, you're likely looking at dropping over $1,000\. The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni seems like an equal, if not better, competitor. Plus, it's hip to be square.

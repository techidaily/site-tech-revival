## Fix 1: Remove or keep away from interference

 Bluetooth uses the 2.4GHz radio frequency to connect with your device, and this is the same frequency of your wireless router. When Wi-Fi could be the biggest interference, other Bluetooth devices can also conflict with your connection. So first check if you’re too close to the router, and move away from other Bluetooth devices.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your Bluetooth driver: manually or automatically.

## Fix 4: Try an external Bluetooth adapter

 If you’re having issues with the Bluetooth adapter that comes with your PC or laptop, maybe you should consider an upgrade. Most of these adapters are still using Bluetooth 4 (or older), while**Bluetooth 5** has already flooded the market. If your device supports Bluetooth 5 (e.g. Apple AirPods), getting a Bluetooth 5 dongle will definitely give you a leg up.

 Bluetooth 5 (or above) introduces[a long range feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth%5F5) that can improve connection and greatly extend the range.

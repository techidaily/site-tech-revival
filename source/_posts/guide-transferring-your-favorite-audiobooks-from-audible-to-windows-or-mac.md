Even if you download the Audible books to computer, but none of the audio player can play the AAX file. Why? In fact, Audible audiobooks are always bundled with its own app (Audible app or specified devices), and they are saved as aax format. But you know the most popular audio format is MP3.

It is a little bit suspicious that your Epubor download link address an older version, is it a FULL (cracked) version or a TRIAL? 

 And the official site has an updated Epubor version named \[Epubor Ultimate\], is your choice if you want the trial or pay for the FULL version.

Hi I wondered as well if the ultimate was truly ultimate, meaning both ebooks and audiobooks but unfortunately the ultimate version is only for ebook files. You will need this other one for audiobook and the only one available is trial (without chapters, just 1 block) or paid (which includes adding chapters).

This doesn't work anymore unfortunately. The audible website does not offer a "download" option. The link that says "Download" forwards you to a page named "how to listen".   
 The section about downloading to a PC, references the old software that is not functional anymore (gives an error saying basically that you can't download anymore.

I just tested this at my computer.It works fine. You are not the first one to report this issue. It seems to be some glitch with certain accounts, if you reported your problem they will help you reset something in your account (updated the download settings).  
 Please contact the customer service to activate the downloading of audible book.

Hello,

 I have an update. I think it has to do with the operating system we are using. I've been trying this on my Windows 7 machine, and whenever I hover over the "Download" button, I can see it's pointing to: /howtolisten  
 I'm guessing because the browser send the information of my operating system and there is no good way to play it on it.   
 I tested it then on my Linux machine, and it works fine. Same account, same day. On Firefox on my Ubuntu, I am able to download the axx files by clicking on the same button.   
 I hope this will help others.

Just had the same problem, but I don't have a Unix machine at home. My solution: Use your phone!  
 \-open the desktop version of the Audible library (on iPhone, hold down the "reload" arrow in the title bar, no idea for Android)  
 \-copy the link behind the Download button  
 \-send it to your PC via mail or whatever

I want to purchase and listen to audio books. But every site seems to offer 128 different possible ways to do this using dozens of apps and hardware devices I don't have. I can't figure out how to get the job done. I can subscribe to services costing $180/year but I don't want to do this if I'm not sure whether it will work out. So I usually quit in frustration and go back to buying CDs at a local bookstore. Is there a simple way to get an audio book?

The Audible book file on my Android 9 device is not .aax, it is .aaxc

 Your program does not recognize the format. For giggles, after I copied it over to the Win10 box, I renamed it to .aax no joy.

 Thoughts?

Unfortunately, the program does not work with the latest files released by Audible in AAXC format. The method you suggested to overcome the obstacle does not work either: in fact, the app window and the Audible website no longer allow downloading of files. It can only be done with the android app but the files are in AAXC format. You should warn customers of this situation instead of redirecting to outdated links!

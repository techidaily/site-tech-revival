**How to Easily Convert Kindle to PDF?**When you purchase an eBook from Amazon Books, you may encounter the issue of your non-Kindle eReader (such as Nook, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader, and others) being unable to open it. Before we delve into the solution, let's briefly discuss eBook formats. As the global leader in eBooks, Kindle books primarily support formats like AZW, KFX, AZW3, PRC, MOBI, and TPZ. However, many other eReaders do not support these formats but instead work with PDF and EPUB formats. So, if you wish to read Kindle books on alternative eReaders, you'll need to convert Kindle AZW, TPZ, PRC, or MOBI files to PDF or EPUB.

### First Things First: Download Kindle Books to Your Computer or eReader

Prior to converting Kindle to PDF, the first step is to download the Kindle titles you've purchased either to your Kindle eReader or your computer using the Kindle desktop app. I've covered this point in detail in the guide "[The Ultimate Guide to Download Kindle Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)".

Once the Kindle books have been successfully downloaded, you can proceed with the conversion to the PDF format using the steps below.

### Can I turn a Kindle book into a PDF with AI?

Year comes to 2024, and the AI is the hottest topic now. I'm so surprised at the video that created by Sora after I typed some texts such as "train goes away", especially when I see reflections flying by outside the car window. 

We may feel curious about the power of AI which may cause more and more people to lose their daily jobs, at the same time we're more interested in the possibilities of what the coming life will be with the help of AI, right? As for me, I then want to test the CHATGPT to confirm whether it could help me turn my kindle book into a PDF. And I did try, finally. 

But, it only shows the result it searched out like what we search on Google, but with better understanding (strong logic). I mean, it shows you how to and explains what you should do and note. I love his answer, but he didn't help resolve my problem.

So, don't waste your time to use an AI tool to help you convert your book. You should use one of above kindle to pdf converter tools to make your issues resolved. 

### FAQs about converting kindle books to PDF

#### How to export from kindle to pdf?

If your books are downloaded via the Kindle Fire or Kindle e-Ink, you can find them stored under "Document" folder after you plugged in via USB. But if your books are downloaded via Kindle app, I highly recommend you use the Kindle desktop app to sync and re-download them for successfully kindle in pdf conversion. 

#### Convert Kindle AZW6 to PDF

After the conversion finished, when we open the PDF book, we will find that all the pages of some **PDF books (which we converted from Kindle) are blank**, but just with one cover image. Why?

It's likely that the original Kindle book you got from amazon store is an azw6 book. This format is only used in Amazon Japan.

Until now I haven't found a tool that could help us directly handle azw6 format Kindle books. The unique solution and easiest way is to **[sync these books via Kindle for PC/Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)** and download them again to your computer, so that epubor or calibre could recognize them.

#### Convert Kindle KFX to PDF

![kindle bookerly kfx](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-bookerly-kfx.jpg)

Since 2017 Amazon started widely using their new format, [KFX](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), into their kindle books, after they upgraded the Kindle desktop version to version 1.19.

The new format features the new enhanced typesetting engine and new Bookerly font. Reading KFX on Kindle devices especailly on KPW3 is really nice and cool, but it's really a pain when we want to read them on non-Kindle devices.

![epubor support kfx](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/epubor-support-kfx.png)

To convert kindle kfx books to pdf, Epubor Ultimate makes things much easier. The latest update ensures you to [remove kindle drm effectively from kindle books downloaded via the latest kindle for PC/Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

Watch the Video tutorial first

#### Convert Kindle to PDF A5 size

Thoug A4 is the default page size, but you know that there are some readers such as Sony DPT-CP1, will only supports A5 PDF. So, is it possible to change or reduce the PDF page size from A4 to A5? The anwser is Yes.

Launch the Epubor Ultimate and click on "User center" -> "Settings" - > "Output" -> "PDF paper size" and target the a5 as the final settings, please. 

![change pdf page size from a4 to a5](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-pdf-a5.png)

![a5 pdf](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/pdf-a5.jpg)Waiting for the job finished. When it's completed, you can click to open the new page size PDF books with Calibre built-in viewer. If you think it's good, then try to transfer the A5 page size PDF book to your Sony digital reader please (may also need Digital Paper App to sync the files).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Please note:** Not all of the PDF books will be displayed correctly or perfectly on your new device after being changed the size into A5\. The PDF output quality is always being the century problems. So here I will recommend you preview the pdf file first before transferring them to your device.

#### Is it possible to change or increase the text size in PDF?

When I convert kindle books to PDF, the text becomes abnormally small. Is it possible to increase the text size for the pdf file? 

If you also meet this issue, I highly recommend you convert the Kindle book to Word (DOCX) format first, and then open the file in a Word and save it again as PDF format.

#### Convert Kindle unlimited to PDF

> I rented books from Amazon kindle, could I convert them to PDF format with your tool? 

Here I would say that neither Epubor Ultimate nor Calibre is able to help convert rented kindle books (from Amazon Prime or Kindle Unlimited). You can only convert your purchased kindle books, not the rented ones. 

#### Can I downlod a kindle books to pdf from Amazon website? 

We can download kindle books from Amazon website by using the "download and transfer via USB" service. But generally, the downloaded file types are AZW3 format, not the PDF. In such case, I will recommend you convert kindle azw3 to PDF with the recommended kindle to pdf converter -- Epubor Ultimate you. 

#### Is it possible to convert kindle books on android? 

No, there is not an android app that supports converting kindle books downloaded via kindle android app. The universal method is to download kindle books to computer and then use a desktop tool to convert your books. 

Say more, epubor team released a tool named [Epubor Kindle Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/kindle-converter/) which works on kindle books downloaded via Kindle android app. But it requires you install an Android emulator on your windows or mac computer such as Android Studio. It's the unique available method to convert kindle kcr format books (kindle manga) to pdf on our Mac at current time. If you prefer to convert kindle manga or kindle photo books, don't hesitate to free trial it. 

![remove kindle drm](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-kindle-drm-mac-m1.png)

#### When I convert my eBook to PDF, the pages are cut off. What should I do? 

> I use the epubor tool to successfully convert my Kindle book to pdf. I have a problem: when i convert my ebook to pdf, the pages are cut. Do you have a solution? 

**Editor's note:** In fact, nearly all of the Kindle to PDF converter tools won't 100% convert Kindle photo / picture eBooks to PDF with high quality. But you are so lucky because the Epubor development team is able to help convert the Kindle Photo book to PDF munually, I mean, without pages cutted. Neither Calibre nor Zamzar online kindle to pdf converter is able to help you resolve this issue. Leave your comment or contact the [Epubor tech-team team](http://www.epubor.com/mailto: epubor.muzhi1989@gmail.com) if you need any help. (fix this issue: the pdf pages get split, showing only half of each page.) 

![pdf pages are cut](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/epubor-resolves-pdf-photo-book.png)

That’s the end of our Kindle AZW/KFX to PDF conversion guide. There are numerous Kindle to PDF converter tools available online, but using a professional eBook converter like [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) makes the conversion process much smoother and unlocks a host of extra capabilities.

I am so frustrated. I have purchased a DRM remover as well as Calibre in order to convert kindle ereaders to PDF so I can read them on my Sony reader. Trouble is I can't see an actual file - I can only access the ebook on the Kindle cloud reader or on the Kindle App on my Windows 8\. But the actual file doesnt appear anywhere in order to import it to Calibre or the DRm remover. HELP!

Hi,

 I've succeeded in converting my Kindle book to ePUB and as pdf.  
 I just don't know how to get it from wherever it is on my MacBookPro into my Kobo. 

 I'm thinking it'd be less of a headache to just buy the friggin book (again) via the Kobo eReader Store!!

 Thanks for any tips to get these last steps...

We aware of this issue. It seems the amazon kindle has changed something in the new published kindle books. It requires the latest kindle app to download it.

 Now we are working on this issue. Once there is a solution, we will let you know. The older kindle books still can be cracked with Epubor Ultimate.

 There is still another way to remove drm from this kind of kindle books if you have any kindle eink device registered with your amazon account. Please download the kindle books via "Download and transfer via usb" and then remove kindle drm with Epubor Ultimate. Here is the detailed guide: <https://www.epubor.com/how-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-kfx-ebooks.html#meth4>

While technically it worked to convert a Kindle book to PDF, it only works with text, all the images were not present, so depending on the book you want as a PDF, this may not help at all. The books I had were heavy on the pictures so this proved to be almost useless.

Thank you for using our software. The trial only allows it to convert 20% content of each book.

Good afternoon, please could you tell me, does the full epubor ultimate software convert kindle books to pdf, so the pdf pages exactly replicate the kindle book formatted pages?

This software is useless. Whatever you do, the DRM stays as it is. Don't waste your money.

Why does the software need so much extra processing time after being purchased? I thought it would be a one-and-done and not a " Wait 5 days for us to process your order" type of thing. Please work on that but other than that the software looks promising.

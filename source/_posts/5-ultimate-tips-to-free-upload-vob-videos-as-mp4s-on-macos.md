## 2\. Free Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with Handbrake

 **Best for free converting VOB/Video\_TS folder VOB to MP4** 

How could we miss Handbrake? Handbrake is the second-to-none video transcoder yet free open source software in video & DVD converting field. It works like a charm in converting videos from almost any format into MP4, MKV, or WebM. Your DVDs are supported seamlessly by it, as well. Therefore, you can use it to convert VOB video or a Video\_TS folder to MP4\. There are a wide selection of pre-programmed settings to help you compress large-sized VOB videos to smaller MP4\. 

A warm prompt is that you'd better upgrade your Handbrake to version 1.5.0 or above. This is because the newer version has fixed couples of issues that you matter a lot, including fixed an issue on older Intel CPUs causing the CLI to fail to initialize, updated Intel Quick Sync to use the Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library, fixed FFmpeg AAC audio encoder quality mode scale range, etc. After all the preparation jobs are done, check the below guide on how to free turn VOB into MP4 with Handbrake. 

Pros:

Both VOB and Video\_TS folder supported.

Free, open source.

Cons:

Unable to remove DRM from video/DVD on its own.

Limited hardware encoder, only VideoToolbox available.

### How to Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac Free with Handbrake?

**Note:** Before you start, you should know that Handbrake can only handle videos/DVDs without DRM. If the VOB video is ripped from an encrypted DVD, the VOB video may contain copy protection. Handbrake can't convert encrypted VOB videos to MP4\. You can [download the libdvdcss on your Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and try again. 

Step 1\. Free download Handbrake on your Mac and double-click on the dmg file to run it.

Step 2\. Click Open Source to select and load the VOB or Video\_TS folder into it. 

Step 3\. Click the Format dropdown menu under the Output Settings section and choose MP4\. Handbrake allows you to convert VOB to MP4 in H.264 or H.265\. It's set to MP4 H.264 by default. 

![free Convert DVD VOB to MP4 on Mac with Handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-interface.png)

Step 4\. Change the Video Codec under the Video tab if necessary. Then click on the Start button to begin. If there is anything unclear, here is a more detailed guide on [how to convert VOB to MP4 using Handbrake >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

###  MacX vs Handbrake Test Comparison in VOB to MP4 Converting:

 In comparison, MacX Video Converter Pro shows times faster than Handbrake, while the output quality is almost the same (it's very very hard to notice the differences and the quality depends on personal feeling).

## 3\. Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with VLC Media Player

 **A 100% free VOB player and converter for Mac** 

Many users rely on VLC to play different videos. It's free and open-source to play a wide range of videos. Do you know you can also use VLC as a free VOB to MP4 converter? In fact, VLC is able to convert videos from one format to the other. It supports VOB video, Video\_TS VOB, DVD, network files, and recordings. 

Given that VLC is primarily designed to be a media player, not a media encoder/transcoder, the VOB to MP4 converting speed and performance are not as good as other free VOB to MP4 converters for Mac listed here. The hardware decoder in Preferences is usally on by default. Yet, the hardware encoder needs to manually turn on, which is not easy to be found. You can follow [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/) to activate hardware encoder in VLC. 

That being said, VLC only supports Apple OpenGL CVPX hw encoder, Intel QSV, AMD VCE or Nvidia NVENC unavailable so far. So the conversion speed becomes a tradeoff for you to understand a free open source application.

Pros:

Free VOB to MP4 converter, downloader, player.

 Easy to use, especially friendly to newbies.

Cons:

Only Apple OpenGL CVPX hardware encoder supported.

Video audio out of sync error happens now and then.

## 10\. Export and Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with iMovie

 **Convert VOB videos to MP4 on Mac with built-in Mac editor**

A Mac user inquired, "Years ago, I recorded a video with my camcorder and saved it onto a DVD. Now, I'm attempting to import these videos from the DVD into iMovie so I can split them into several videos for sharing on YouTube. The videos are in VOB format. Can I export VOB to MP4 on Mac using iMovie?"

iMovie's High Quality setting facilitates the conversion of VOB files to MP4 on Mac. Simply import your .vob files into iMovie and proceed to export them. The resulting files will be in MP4/AAC format across all iMovie settings except for Best Quality (pro res), which yields a file size four times larger than the MP4 due to its significantly higher bitrate. Therefore, for space efficiency, it's recommended to use the High Quality setting rather than Best Quality (pro res). 

Pros:

Free and easy.

Mac built-in video editor.

Cons:

No flexible settings.

Limited output/input format support.

### How to Export and Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with iMovie?

Step 3\. Click Next. In the ensuing dialog box, either enter a name in the Save As field or leave the default name. Navigate to the location where you want to save the file, and click Save.

## Part 2\. Common Problems During VOB to MP4 Conversion on Mac

Converting VOB to MP4 on Mac is anything but smooth. There are complaints about the sound, subtitles, codecs, etc. converting using HandBrake or others. While free VOB to MP4 converting on Mac can be loaded with problems, sad users can take solace in the fact that the VOB to MP4 converters above have fixed some common problems you may have experienced: 

### 1\. VOB to MP4 sound problems

"When I try to free [convert a vob to mp4 with Handbrake](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) on Mac, the sound of some files are horrible (distorted) after the conversion, but the vob plays with no problem." Most users who ran into sound problem will have audio distortion or bad sound quality, while some even worse, get no sound after the conversion. 

### 2\. Vob conversion error with subtitles

Another common problem with Mac freeware involves video subtitles. For example, "I've converted the VOB files to MP4's, but the subtitles are gone! All I really need is a program that will keep the subs ON, after conversion from a VOB.", or "the subs are improperly synced with the audio in the exported MP4, while the vob file ripped from DVD was OK."

### 3\. Vob to mp4 conversion on mac finishes parts only

Sometimes the free tool won't convert the full VOB files without giving any reason. After an hour or so, the ended file gives about 1/3 the size and it only gets the first part finished in MP4 format. 

### 4\. Corrupted vob file

Many users may have some corrupted vob files but can't get a solution to process them. "I need the last part of a vob file but there is corruption approx half through the video. The error prevents me to free transcoding VOB files to mp4 on mac." To be specific, this is not a converting problem. 

### 5\. Incorrect aspect ratio

The output MP4 videos are different from the original vob files on the display screens. As a user complain that "the new mp4 file was about 50% of the original width and therefore the videos are distorted." For those who want the picture to fill the entire screen of the TV or computer, the distorted or out-of-shape image looks really disappointing. 

### 6\. Audio/Video out of sync

"I am attempting to convert the VOB files to MP4 for more compatible use on Mac but have issues with the audio once the conversion is complete. The audio first starts out correct but later on it starts to go out-of-sync." Some users are experiencing A/V out of sync errors after they convert VOB to MP4 on Mac, while some others get no audio after the conversion. 

To get rid of any of the above errors, get MacX Video Converter Pro and freely convert VOB to MP4 videos on Mac (macOS 13 Ventura incl.)

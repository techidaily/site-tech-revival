## Why Can't I Delete Video from iPhone?

Even if you follow the above guide, you may still encounter problems to get videos off your iPhone successfully. So below we also gather some common problems and fixes to help you. 

**No trash can icon or trash can icon grayed out**

Like the users who cried that there was no Remove button, a lot of users can't find where to delete the videos. This is mainly because the videos they're trying to delete have been stored and synced on the computer. To fix this, you will need to remove the videos from the computer and then sync the changes to the iPhone. 

**Deleted videos are still here on iPhone**

Some others may be surprised that the videos they already deleted appear again on their iPhone. This is also caused by syncing settings in iTunes. First, open iTunes and go to Summary > Manually manage music and videos. Similarly, if the videos are synced from computer or iTunes library, you can't delete them directly from iPhone. You will also need to remove the videos in iTunes and sync to iPhone, or every time you connect iPhone to the computer, iTunes may auto sync the videos to your device.

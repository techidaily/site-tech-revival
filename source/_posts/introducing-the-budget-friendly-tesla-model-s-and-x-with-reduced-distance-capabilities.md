## Introducing the Budget-Friendly Tesla Model S & X with Reduced Distance Capabilities

Tesla has quietly released a new shorter "Standard Range" version of the Model S and Model X at a significant discount and the most affordable variant of each model. While we've seen several versions of both vehicles, this is the first time buyers can choose a Standard Range option for the S/X since 2021.

 Specifically, you can now buy a Tesla Model S or the Model X at a $10,000 discount, but you'll get less range. For example, the new [Model S Standard Range](https://www.tesla.com/models/design#overview) is only $78,490 (vs. $88,490) and gets around 320 miles per charge. The more expensive trim is capable of 405 miles per charge. The Model X typically sits around the $100,000 mark, but this new Standard Range Model X starts at $88,490 and only gets 270 miles on a charge. Prices exclude potential savings, EV tax credits, or a [destination fee](https://www.reviewgeek.com/133630/what-is-a-new-car-destination-fee/).

 Would you pay $10,000 less to get a vehicle capable of 85 fewer miles between charges? That sounds like a pretty decent deal, especially for city driving. Are these new vehicles arriving with a smaller battery pack, or is Tesla returning to its old ways and software-locking the battery cell?

 According to [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2023/08/15/teslas-new-model-s-x-same-battery-pack-but-with-software-locked-capacity/), it's the latter, and Tesla confirmed the new Standard Range Model S/X have the same battery as more expensive models, only they're locked to reduce the range for a lower price point. This means you carry around extra weight, but it's at a significant discount.

 However, there is a chance that Tesla will let owners pay to unlock the additional range at a later date, as we've seen in the past, but that's unconfirmed. It's a controversial way to sell a vehicle, but buyers still get what they pay for and can opt for the more expensive model if they need more range. For those unaware, back in 2019, Tesla remotely unlocked that extra range on the Model S/X during some California wildfires, helping owners get to safety.

 We don't know if Tesla will ever [let owners unlock the extra range](https://www.reviewgeek.com/111381/you-dont-really-ever-own-an-ev/) these new "Standard Range" trims have on the inside, but at least there's now a more affordable option for those interested.

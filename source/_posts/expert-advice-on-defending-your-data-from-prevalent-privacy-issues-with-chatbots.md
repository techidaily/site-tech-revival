 Went to log into ChatGPT but it won't work? Sounds like ChatGPT is down. While the world's leading generative AI chatbot doesn't often suffer outages, when ChatGPT is offline, it's a massive pain.

 So, is ChatGPT down for everyone else, or are you the only one who can't use it? Here's how you find out.

## 1 Check OpenAI's Status Page

![openai chatgpt status monitor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/openai-chatgpt-status-monitor.jpg)

[ChatGPT is packed with excellent features](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-features-you-arent-using-but-should/) , but sometimes, it stops working.

 The easiest way to check if ChatGPT is down is to use[OpenAI](https://status.openai.com/) for real-time server analysis, which will show you if ChatGPT is down for everyone, or if there is an issue at your end.

## 2 Check the ChatGPT App

 One alternative is to try the ChatGPT app on your mobile device.[ChatGPT is available for iOS and Android devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-android-and-ios/) and includes many of the same features as the web version. When ChatGPT is down in your browser, try jumping over to your mobile device to check if it's an issue with your machine rather than the service itself.

 Or, as I realized during a ChatGPT outage, the opposite can be true; ChatGPT was working in a web browser but wasn't working in the app. Try both ways to figure it out!

## 3 Check OpenAI's X Account

 Sometimes, when there is a problem with OpenAI servers, it may be announced on the[OpenAI X account](https://twitter.com/OpenAI) . So, it's wise to follow their account and check it if you suspect ChatGPT has stopped working.

 Also, at times, they put out an announcement once they fix the problem, so you should turn on X notifications on your phone.

 If you couldn't find any helpful information about why ChatGPT isn't working on OpenAI's status site or its X account, you can try a third-party platform. Use[Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/status/openai/) to find out if ChatGPT stopped working for other users or if it's a problem limited to your device.

 If there's nothing you can do, but you still need an AI tool, there are several[ChatGPT alternatives to help you](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/) .

## 5 Check if ChatGPT Is Available in Your Region

 Even if you can't access ChatGPT, there's a chance there's nothing wrong with it. If you travel to a region where ChatGPT isn't available, you'll get the "OpenAI services are not available in your country" message.

 The same goes if you're using a VPN and have set your virtual location to a country where ChatGPT isn't available. If you're unsure whether the AI tool is available in your country, you can check[ChatGPT's Supported Countries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries) .

## 6 Use a ChatGPT Alternative

![google gemini question example](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-gemini-question-example.jpg)

 I know; ChatGPT is the best generative AI chatbot. It's been proved over and over again. But there are a[bunch of excellent ChatGPT alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/) you can use to answer your pressing questions. ChatGPT alternatives include Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, Meta AI, and Perplexity, and that's just getting started.

 You might find the answers a little different, and each AI chatbot has its quirks, but you should find that most are perfectly serviceable. Of course, if you have a specific project in ChatGPT, being unable to access it is a pain, but an alternative AI chatbot will be able to field most general questions. In some cases, you may find a[ChatGPT alternative produces better results](https://www.makeuseof.com/github-copilot-vs-chatgpt-which-better-programming/) in certain areas, like programming.

 It's frustrating when ChatGPT is down. Don't forget to try the old tried and tested methods, too. Did you switch your router on and off? How about resetting your computer to see if that works? Either way, given ChatGPT's importance to the world, it never takes long before OpenAI get ChatGPT up and running once again.

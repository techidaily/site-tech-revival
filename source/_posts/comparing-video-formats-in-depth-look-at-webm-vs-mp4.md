## Part 1\. Similarities and Differences Between MP4 and WebM

### MP4 vs WebM: Quality

The most concerned factor for a video format is how a video with that format looks like. Compare WebM quality with MP4, which is better? As a matter of fact, for the video quality of WebM vs MP4, it all comes down to the codecs. Generally, the output of the MP4 format is extremely high quality, as crisp and clear as that of a DVD.

WebM also comes in high quality. But comparing MP4 in quality, WebM is a little bit inferior. Take the two codecs of each format for example, in the vp8 vs h264 round, both VP8 and H.264 videos yield approximately the same quality at the same bitrate. But the High Profile H.264 is by comparison very ahead of in quality which VP8 may never surpass it.

### Compare WebM to MP4: Size

The video size of a file can decide how many movies or videos can be stored in your mobile devices, or whether your videos can be uploaded to video-sharing sites. Both WebM and MP4 in fact are compressed into a relatively small file size, however, differences still exist as for MP4 vs WebM comparison. Movies in MP4 can be downloaded quickly via the internet using the high-speed broadband connections currently available. But developed with a purpose for providing DVD quality pictures, a MP4 video can sometimes be very large.

Used more for Internet streaming, WebM videos are more popular on YouTube or other Google sites. As technology works by compressing the files, making the overall size of WebM much smaller compared with MP4, WebM videos are much more accessible and files can be downloaded quickly from the internet.

### WebM vs MP4: Compatibility and Usage

You will benefit from having any devices iPhone, iPad, Android, browsers Chrome, Safari, IE 10 (with the help of HTML5 or Flash) and any players play this specific format with MP4 files.

Well in the comparison between WebM and MP4, it's obviously that WebM is the underdog. Currently, most web browsers have updated to support HTML5 WebM video playback, including Chrome, IE, Firfox, Opera and Safari (available for macOS Big Sur 11.3 or higher). But Safari for mobile version still doesn't work with HTML5 webM (VP8/9) yet.

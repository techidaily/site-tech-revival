###  Give a book as present

Now that we have got the Kindle devices as gifts, how about giving a book as present? This would be a meaningful gift for kids. I guess there must be something different, that you can share a suitable book for kids with your children and talk about the content with them. Currently there are many eBook retailers on the market, including Nook, Kobo, Kindle and Google provide "give a book as present" function or gift card option for us. For detailed information, you can refer to the guide [how to gift an eBook](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to learn more details.

All of these mentioned above are the Kindle gifts for kids 2015 Xmas, hope you can find the best presents for your children.

How to listen to Audible audiobooks on Kindle Fire? Below are detailed steps.

Step 1\. Open the Kindle Fire, you will find “Audiobooks” tab on the top bar of the home screen. All purchased audiobooks will be showed in the library when you tap "Audiobooks". If you want to buy a new audible audiobooks, just click ”store” at the top right to go to the store.

 Next time when you want to listen to an audiobook, tap "Audiobooks" from the home screen, and then tap the book title, it will start from the place where the last time you stop listening.

#### Situation 2: Purchase your Audible audiobooks via Audible account

If you already have an Audible account which is different from your Amazon account, your purchased audiobooks will not be shown in your Audiobooks library on your Kindle Fire. You need to link your Audible account to your Amazon account in this case.

Step 1\. Go to Audible.com and sign in using your existing Audible account. There will be **_hi, username_** _at_ the top of the website. Select the **“** _**Account Details”** from the drop-down list of **hi, username.**_

Step 2\. Click on **_NEW: Connect your Amazon account to Audible!_** to go to another page to merge your account. 

Step 3\. Enter your Audible passwords, and click **_next step_**. Then enter your Amazon username and passwords and click on “_**next step**_”.

Until now, your Audible and Amazon account has been linked together successfully. And then when you open your Kindle Fire, you will find all your purchased Audible books will be showed in library of Audiobooks on Kindle fire. Then you can follow instructions of the situation 1 to listen the audiobooks.

Note: When your Audible account has been merged with your Amazon account successfully, your old Audible username will no longer work. So you will access your Audible account with your Amazon credentials.

Bonus Tip

One important thing to be mentioned about Audible books is that all Audible books are protected by DRM scheme. So all your downloaded Audible file will be in Audible AAX or AAXC format which means you are not able to play Audible file on many mainstream mp3 player. In order to enjoy Audible on any player, you can **[convert Audible to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)** with **[Epubor Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/)**.

All audible books are protect with DRM, so you can not listen to these audible books if you do not remove the drm from it. Epubor audible converter (https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) can help you remove audible drm and convert audible to mp3\. Then you can play the audible file at mp3 supported player.

Sorry for the late reply. You can listen to your audible books by simply saying, "Alexa, play the audiobook" followed by the title.

 Happy holidays! I hope you can help! Yesterday, we gave our son for Xmas a Fire HD8\. He has an Audible account and was synching his account (on his iphone11) with this gift. He was able to do that but noticed that the highlight feature (or is that the bookmark) cannot be turned off on the tablet. He is able to do that on his phone.

 We don’t want to have to return this tablet.....please help! Thanks in advance

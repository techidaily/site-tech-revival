[Epubor VitalSource Downloader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/24/2019 9:22:32 AM 

Epubor VitalSource Downloader is not accessing all of my titles for download. I can only access the most recently purchased lifetime purchase. There were 2 more titles I bought before that, and I can still access them through VtialSource. Is this a glitch?

[Please refresh your browser?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/30/2019 4:22:06 AM 

Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

[Kindle for PC App Updating Automatially (without permission)](http://www.epubor.com/kindle-for-pc-app-updating-automatially-without-permission.html) \-- 10/24/2020 10:51:45 AM 

Hi Everyone, I've got a Kindle question I'm hoping someone can help with. I use the Kindle for PC app (Australia) to download books I buy so I can back them up. I have cleared the 'automatic update' box, but this morning it still updated without my permission. It will now not let me downgrade, and no matter which version of the app I download, when it is installed it is the current version 1.30\. I'm using Windows 10\.   
 I'm stuck, any suggestions?

[Kindle registration page stuck in eternal reload loop](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/20/2021 8:38:14 AM 

I have Windows 10\. I bought Epubor Ultimate. It told me I had to install an earlier version of the Kindle App. With Epubor's assitance, it downloaded and installed Kindle version 1.24.51068\. The app works fine UNTIL I go to register it with Amazon. It just loops the login screen over and over nonstop. The reload is so fast I can't even type a single letter.

 Suggestions? This software is useless to me unless I can get to my Kindle books I've purchased.

[Unable to remove Nook DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/14/2019 8:41:24 AM 

I have downloaded Epubor and trying to remove the DRM from a Nook book that I had recently purchased. I went through the steps on https://www.epubor.com/faq.html#e303 and downloaded/installed Nook Study but was unable to login. I am not sure what I am not doing correctly unless it is that I have to purchase the licensed version of Epubor. If that is the case, I will do so, but I wanted to test it out first to make sure it will remove the Nook DRM.

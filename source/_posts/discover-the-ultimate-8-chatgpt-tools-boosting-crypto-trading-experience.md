 If this is the first you've heard of GPT-4 Turbo, it's one of the more advanced AI models at the time of writing. It's designed by OpenAI, the people who invented the[wildly popular ChatGPT service](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/) .

 To put GPT-4 Turbo into perspective; when ChatGPT went viral, it was using the 3.5 model. After that, OpenAI released the GPT-4 model, which could handle queries better and sounded more human. Finally, they made the model process faster and thus arrived at GPT-4 Turbo.

 Right now, the best way to use GPT-4 Turbo for free is via Microsoft Copilot. It may seem weird that you have to go through Microsoft instead of OpenAI, but the two companies have a really close relationship. As such, it's not unusual to see OpenAI's features appear within Microsoft's AI assistants.

## Why MKV Has No Sound in QuickTime? How to Play MKV Files in QuickTime without Error 

MKV is an open and free video container format, which can contain several aduio and subtitle tracks in one file, making it a preferred format to save videos with multile tracks, such as videos converted from DVDs, or movie resource files from online. However, Apple users find they cannot play MKV files in QuickTime Player on Mac, getting an error message "QuickTime Player can't open xxx.mkv". Even if they opened MKV files after Perian installed, the **MKV video plays but no sound in QuickTime**.

Can't hear any sound when playing MKV files in QuickTime

Generally, QuickTime itself has never supported opening MKV files let alone playing it. You need install a QuickTime plugin like Perian to make QuickTime available to convert MKV to MP4, MOV for limitless playback. But the truth is, this only works for video format instead of audio codec. Most MKV files come from DVD videos, the audio streams are most likely **encoded in Dolby-AC3 or DTS format**, which is not supported in most players, including QuickTime. Thus it will refuse to play the MKV file or just play the video without audio. Even those MKV files with both supported or unsupported audio streams, QuickTime may automatically select an unsupported audio steam by accident, causing no sound in QuickTime.

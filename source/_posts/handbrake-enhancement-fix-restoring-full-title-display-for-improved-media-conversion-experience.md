_"HandBrake not showing all the titles on the disc. I ripped anime DVDs to my external hard drive. The problem was the software only shows one episode on the disc released by Sentai Filmworks. I don't know if Funimation and Sentai DVDs have a different format. What should I do to rip all my DVDs? Any help?" - from HandBrake forum_

HandBrake is a great open source video transcoding program, but errors are also common during media processing, and HandBrake not showing all titles is one of them. For example, the DVD has 12 episodes, but HandBrake only recognizes 6 sections of them and offers duplicates of some of the scanned titles. And sometimes the detected titles are not the main features. It's less mentioned compared to other issues like HandBrake no valid source found, no title found, not ripping the whole movie, etc. and few users really know how to fix it. If you have this issue, follow our troubleshooting guide below.

## Download Top DVD Decrypter to Handle 99-title DVDs

HandBrake itself is not a DVD ripper designed to handle commercial encrypted DVDs (esp. encrypted with multiple DVD tiltes) and may not show all sections or the main title. 

Thus, you need robust DVD ripping software like **[MacX DVD Ripper Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)** to recognize your copyright protected DVDs. It is able to defeat any type of copy protection and work with any DVD you throw at, such as **Disney 99-title DVDs**, anime DVDs, TV shows on DVDs, Hollywood DVDs, workout DVDs, damaged/bad sector DVDs, fake playlist DVDs and more. The DVD decrypter can scan all titles quickly and automatically pick out the right movie title for users. No libdvdcss library needed!

### 1\. General Troubleshooting steps

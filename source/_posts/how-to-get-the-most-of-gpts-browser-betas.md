### Key Takeaways

* ChatGPT offers custom GPTs to help you perform several actions.
* Use custom GPTs to design better prompts, get gym routines, tweak your resume, and more.

 ChatGPT on its own is great, but did you know that you can use custom GPTs to streamline its functionality? Custom GPTs can teach you how to code, plan trips, transcribe videos, and much, much more, and there are heaps for you to choose from.

 So, here are the best custom GPTs that actually make ChatGPT a better tool for any situation.

## 1 [Diagrams: Show Me](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5QhhdsfDj-diagrams-show-me)

 The Diagrams: Show Me GPT plugin quickly visualizes all kinds of information in diagrams. You can use this add-on to view promotion paths at companies you want to work for, and it’s also handy if you need general flow charts (for example, we asked Diagrams: Show Me to outline the process from freelancing to running an agency).

![The Diagrams: Show Me Custom GPT in Action](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-10-49-15.png)

 Once you’ve created an initial prototype, you can make adjustments by giving the GPT new instructions. Alternatively, you can edit the image with code instead if you know how to. You can use Diagrams: Show Me to[optimize productivity with workflow diagrams](https://www.makeuseof.com/optimize-productivity-with-workflow-diagram/) for your personal and work projects.

## 2 [Canva](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-alKfVrz9K-canva)

 Canva is one of the most popular platforms for designing graphics online, and several[Canva apps are worth checking out to create better designs](https://www.makeuseof.com/canva-apps-worth-trying/) . The Canva GPT plugin helps you create all kinds of content, such as Instagram posts and logos.

 When you use the Canva custom GPT, you may notice that some of the text in your visuals overlay other boxes. Fortunately, when you click on a design prototype, the GPT will redirect you to the Canva app. Here, you can make any edits you feel are necessary—such as resizing text and adding new images.

 Creating slides that are informative and engaging is crucial in workspaces and when studying. However, deciding how to lay out your slides can be challenging. The Presentation Slides GPT plugin is designed to help minimize the manual work.

 You can ask Presentation Slides to outline your presentation, meaning that you can take what you like and adapt everything in your preferred presentation creator later. Besides organizing information, presentation slides can guide you in designing a layout that fits your project theme.

## 4 [Math Solver](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-9YeZz6m6k-math-solver)

 While some people have no problems working out mathematical equations, it’s not simple for everyone. If you struggle with numbers but want to improve your math skills, consider using the Math Solver custom GPT.

 You can ask Math Solver for help with simple and complex equations. The GPT walks you through how to solve each one and explains the concept. You also get useful related questions to help you continue enhancing your skills.

![The Math Solver Custom GPT ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-06-12.png)

 Although Math Solver is good for understanding how to solve mathematical problems, you shouldn’t use it to cheat on your homework or exams. In fact, there are many[ways that you should not use ChatGPT as a student](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-not-use-student/) —such as relying on the program to write essays for you.

## 5 [Travel Guide](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-E7eSRUHy6-travel-guide)

 Do you have a big upcoming trip, or are you simply researching potential adventures? Consider using the Travel Guide GPT plugin to help you gather essential information and plan your itinerary.

 Travel Guide is pretty good at providing an itinerary outline for you to build upon later. For example, you can use the days it gives you and then do extra research elsewhere for places to eat, where to stay, etc.

![An itinerary designed by the Travel Guide Custom GPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-13-08.png)

 Besides planning itineraries, Travel Guide can offer budget travel tips for specific destinations. For example, we asked the Travel Guide GPT to help us visit Switzerland on a budget of 80 Swiss Francs (c. $88 per day), excluding hotels.

 If you’re interested in a unique adventure, consider reading these[inspiring travel blogs of adventurers who trek the world on foot](https://www.makeuseof.com/inspiring-travel-blogs-adventurers-trek-the-world-on-foot/) .

## 6 [Scholar GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-kZ0eYXlJe-scholar-gpt)

 Academic research is a strenuous process regardless of your experience, but AI tools can help you streamline the process and provide more context. Scholar GPT is one of those. With this GPT, you can upload research paper PDFs and links to receive analysis.

![The Scholar GPT plugin analyzing a research paper](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-25-26.png)

 Are you new to the world of coding? If so, consider trying the Code Tutor GPT plugin. Code Tutor helps users understand different coding concepts and jargon, and it can also help you become more effective with implementation and planning processes.

![The Code Tutor Custom GPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-36-50.png)

 Code Tutor can also help users with topics they may have for homework. The GPT often asks you to provide further context for every prompt you send, which helps it give you a more accurate answer.

## 9 [Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant by Rogan Keel](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-QdyESXhOY-gym-fitness-exercise-training-assistant)

 Walking into the gym for the first time can be incredibly daunting, especially if you know little or nothing about fitness. Creating a program is also difficult; I still vividly remember spending hours on bodybuilding forums when I first began training in 2014\. Fortunately, getting the information you need is much easier these days—and Rogan Keel’s Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant is a helpful custom GPT for new gym-goers.

 To use this GPT more effectively, make sure you give it as much information as possible. For example, I gave it my story of what my health condition was like when I first wanted to go to the gym and mentioned dietary requirements. You should also mention how many days you’d like to exercise per week. After giving the assistant all the required information, you’ll get an overview of your diet and exercise regimen.

![An overview provided by the Gym, Fitness, & Training Planner custom GPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-44-47.png)

 Below the overview, you’ll find further details of your training plan. If you want to keep everything handy, you can also request a PDF. There are plenty of other[online sources for workout programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-online-sources-workout-programs/) where you can also get further help with your fitness journey.

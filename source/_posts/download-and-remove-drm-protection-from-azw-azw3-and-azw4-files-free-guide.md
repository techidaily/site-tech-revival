Do you have any trouble with downloading AZW3 files to kindle fire via USB cable? Unable to read azw3 on the Kindle? In fact, it seems that Amazon is adopting some standard set of ebook formats (AZW3/AZW4) and wrapping them with their own DRM. Because the azw3/azw4 format is new but there isn't much news about it. We know more information about the azw format. The easy way to solve this question is that we can import AZW, AZW1, AZW3, AZW4 files to kindle DRM removal tools and remove drm in 3 steps.

### Difference between All Set of .AZW Formats

AZW format is compatible with Kindle device, iOS eReader application and Kindle for PC software. The extension of azw is widely used in the ebooks which is **protected from DRM or unprotected**.

The nickname of AZW1 format is Topz (.tpz) which **contains Amazon DRM scheme** and adopts PalmOS container format.

The AZW3 and AZW4 are the new different formats. As usual, they are protected by DRM. AZW3 also called KF8 has a **fixed layout**. The 4th Kindle devices with firmware v4.1.0 or later, Kindle for PC and Kindle for Mac can recognize it.

AZW4 contains PDF file and some extra info. At present, this format is just supported by Kindle for PC and Kindle for Mac applications. Therefore, it **cannot be read** by Kindle reading apps and the Kindle Fire DX. Moreover it's sometimes involved with DRM.

In customer discussions of Amazon Kindle, the topic about how to open azw3 file is frequently discussed.

One method is to change the extension of azw3 file, taking the 3 off azw3\. For example, change ABC.azw3 to ABC.azw. It will show up on the kindle fire and can be recognized by your Mac or Windows. It can be open sometimes **without DRM protection**.

Method 2: You need to deregister your kindle then register it. **Attention**! Please delete items from kindle fire and just sync all DRM files with the same account, rather than download or email them from computer or the devices. So you can open the all azw, azw1, azw3, azw4 with DRM protection.

All in all, once and for all is to download all set of AZW formats **DRM Removal Tools for Amazon Kindle eBooks**. As we know, the non-DRM format is similar to mobi and mobi is widely read by all Kindle devices and eBook reading application.

### Make All Variation of .AZW Read Easily

Because of some abnormal operations, we often can't open a set of azw formats wrapped with DRM protection. For example, we often copy or transfer drm books to other devices without a correct method.

Why do I say that? When the Kindle is purchased, the Amazon DRM scheme is built on the Kindle device id which is pre-registered automatically on an Amazon account. Therefore your drm ebooks is locked to the devices. If you want to open these books, make sure register devices (computer, Kindle devices, iOS devices.) with the purchased Amazon account. Then redownload them from these devices rather than copying or transferring simply.

> Can I read Nook books on Kindle Paperwhite? I've purchased numerous books from Barnes & Noble, but I'd prefer not to be confined to the Nook ecosystem.

You may wonder that how to read Nook books on Kindle. "How can I read Nook books on Kindle” is always the most frequently asked question. The easiest way is converting Nook to Kindle. Here is the simplest and 100% valid method to convert Nook books to Kindle in the year of 2024.

![remove nook drm](http://www.epubor.com/./images/uppic/convert-nook-to-kindle-2020.png)

Note: If you still have Nook App for Windows installed and can download Nook books via it, then a much easier way to**_[remove Nook drm from books downloaded via Nook Windows App](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)_** is here. Otherwise, you'd better follow the steps below to download Nook books and remove drm with Nook Converter. It is the only valid method in 2024.

###  Step 1\. Download Nook Books to Computer

The Barnes & Noble eBooks are available in EPUB or PDF formats, while the Amazon Kindle only supports MOBI, AZW3, or KFX formats. That's why we need to convert Nook books to Kindle format.

Before converting Nook ebooks to a Kindle-supported format, we have to remove drm from Nook books.

To remove Nook DRM, the first step is to download the Nook books to your computer. Barnes & Noble ebooks cannot be downloaded via web browsers anymore. Furthermore, the Nook desktop application has been removed from the Nook server for quite some time, making it difficult for Nook users to download their books. However, with some effort and research, it is still possible to download Nook ebooks to a computer.

The only valid method to download Nook books to a computer is by using Nook for Android on Android Emulator. This means that if you can install Android emulator on your Windows and Mac, it is easy for you to download Nook ebooks and Audiobooks.

Your product does not work for All Nook books. Is there another way to convert Nooks into Kindle format. If not, then please update your website with the disclaimer that it doesn't work for all nook books, especially for big name authors like JD Robb or the Game of Thrones books etc.

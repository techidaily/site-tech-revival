As we know, both Mobi and EPUB are popular known formats. But actually they are not so widely used as PDF, because PDF is supported by more devices or platforms. Sometimes the reading device or app may support pdf better than ePub or Mobi. So converting EPUB and Mobi books to PDF is necessary. You may are looking for a solution to convert the format, but cannot find a satisfactory answer. Here are the useful ways to help you deal with your conversion problem. 

### Why we need to convert EPUB or Mobi files to PDF

**For Mobi to PDF**

Mobi is Amazon's unique eBook format, we can only read them on Kindle app or Kindle device. Currently, eReader on the market almost support PDF or EPUB files not Kindle format. Converting Mobi to PDF, we can:

**1\.** Read Mobi files on more available devices support PDF files, such as Kobo, Nook, Sony eReader and iPad.

**2\.** Print the converted PDF files, because Kindle for PC/Mac or Kindle device does not provide any print function.

**For EPUB to PDF**

Both PDF and EPUB are open standard format, though they are supported by multiple devices or platform, there are still many differences between them. So why we need to convert EPUB to PDF?

**1.** PDF files can be digitally signed, we can set password to securely locked against copying, printing, even opening.

**2\.** PDF files keep the original layout of any document which has all kinds of data, such as text, multimedia, video, maps, full-color graphics and photos.

There are enough reasons for us to convert EPUB and Mobi files to PDF. Next, I will teach you how to for details.

### Convert DRM-free EPUB Mobi to PDF

In this part, I will introduce 2 EPUB and Mobi to PDF converters for you, including online eBook converter and a freeware eBook converter Calibre.

1 **Online eBook Converter**

If you don't like to install any third-party app on your computer, you can choose online eBooks converter to help you directly convert EPUB and Mobi files to PDF online, which is totally free. 

Currently, there are so many online eBook converter tools on the market that you may don't know which one is better. Here I recommend 3 useful online eBook converters that I prefer for you: [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/), and [eBook.online-convert](http://ebook.online-convert.com/). As we have already written related content about it, I will not explain it here again. Please click [how to convert EPUB to PDF online](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and [convert Mobi to PDF online](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to learn the details.

2 **Calibre**

As we know, calibre is a free and open-source software which allows us to edit, read eBooks and convert eBook format. It supports a variety of formats, including Mobi, EPUB, PDF, etc. Now, let's learn how to use it to convert EPUB and Mobi books to PDf step by step.

**Step1:** Download and install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download).

**Step2:** After you have installed it on your computer successfully, please launch it and drag your EPUB and Mobi files to its main interface, or you can click "Add books" button on the top left corner of the software to add your books.

**Step3:** Select all the EPUB and Mobi books you need to convert, click "Convert books" at the top navigation bar, then it will pop up another window, just choose PDF as output format, then tap "Ok" to start converting EPUB and Mobi files to PDF.

Then you can see a conversion process at the bottom right corner, when the number turns to "0", it shows all your books have been converted successfully.

To find your converted PDF books, please right-click your added book, select "Open containing folder" to open the folder which saves your PDF files.

Each converted PDF file is saved in a different folder, if you need to convert many books at a time, when you select all the book and click "Open containing folder", it will pop up several window which shows your converted PDF files. It's not very convenient for us to find and transfer these files.

**Note:** Both online eBook converter and Calibre can only convert DRM-free EPUB Mobi files to PDF. If your books are DRM-protected, none of them can convert format successfully.

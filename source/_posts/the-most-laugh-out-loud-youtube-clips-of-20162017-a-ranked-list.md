**1\. Bat Dad Vine Compilation** 

Blake Wilson goes by Bat Dad on Vine. He is not only a dad of four kids from Atlanta but also the hero of suburbia, and he's funnier than anything we've seen on Vine, at least this year. 

**2\. Extremely Scary Ghost Elevator Prank in Brazil** 

One thing is for sure: prank shows in Brazil aren't fooling around. This is probably the most terrifying prank I've ever seen. But it's just for fun. 

**3\. Cat Making Funny Noise While Eating** 

Is it a purr? Is it a song? Either way, it's intensely cute when this hungry feline gets its food. Anyway, it has made me laugh without fail every time I watch it. 

**4\. Christina Bianco Diva Impressions 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart'**

Comedian and impressionist Christina Bianco just went to the top of our favorite people list. She impersonates some divas better than others but I have to give her props. 

**5\. Australian Newscaster Finds Out Who Grumpy Cat Is, Can't Handle It** 

This interview is amazing, and probably the best thing to come out of the Today show franchise in just about ever. This story would brighten up a few smiles here. 

**6\. How Animals Eat Their Food**

This YouTube video involves one man's over-the-top impressions of just that. It's funny. It's weird. It's also extremely popular with Internetters, racking up nearly 7 million views since hitting YouTube on Monday. 

**7\. Julie and the Deathly Surgeon**

If you were in a sorrowful mood, this video clip can be an effective way to let you laugh and forget your sorrows.

**8\. Paula Deen- Gastro Ghouls n' Fear Fritters** 

Someone slowed down the audio on a Paula Deen appearance on the Oprah show a couple years ago, the results are simply pants-wettingly funny, and maybe a bit frightening.

**9\. YouForgotBlueberries.com** 

When referring to Cameron directed movies, Titanic is surely his masterpiece. But for sci-fi movie followers, Avatar is the way to go. The movie's scale is undeniably impressive and also deserves to be one of the top ten Oscar award movies of all time. 

**10\. Talking Kitty** 

Sylvester and Gibson are threatened by an angry landlord, spiders and bacon. This is the first Talking Kitty video of 2015.

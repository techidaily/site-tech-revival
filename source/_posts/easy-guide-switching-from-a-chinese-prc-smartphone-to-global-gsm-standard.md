As a Kindle lover, like me, we are so familiar with these two formats, prc and mobi, yes? They are 2 of the kindle eBook formats, widely used and supported on kindle devices and apps.

But today my concern is not about the difference between them, but the conversion from prc to mobi. For why, and how to, follow this guide below please.

### Why we convert prc to mobi

Firstly both prc and mobi are ebook file extension created by Mobipocket, but since Amazon acquired them in 2005, these 2 formats are used more widely in kindle ebooks.

#### When will we get prc files?

If you downloaded your purchased kindle books on **Kindle Fire or Android devices** **with Kindle for Android app**, your downloaded files would be PRC format.

PRC file is just a "container" format, a little like a "zip" file. And among our downloaded prc books, some of them may be drm free, and the other may be DRM protected. DRM free prc are nearly the same as mobi, but DRM protected prc are different.

#### When will we get mobi files?

Mobi format was firstly developed for the Mobipocket Reader, but now it is used by Amazon with a little different DRM scheme and called AZW. In other words, when DRM free, mobi is mobi; when DRM added, books will be mobi, or azw, or azw3 (a variation of AZW).

**Note:**  
 Now most of mobi files are drm free, becasue Amazon transform drm protected files to kfx, azw or azw3.

Compared with PRC, Mobi files have much richer metadata, such as author, title, cover image, etc. It's more compatible with reading devices, not only Android, but also Mac, Windows, iPad, with reading apps. So to sum up:

#### Why we convert prc to mobi?

\--PRC files are downloaded with Android, not compatible with other eReaders. When we want to read those downloaded files from android to iPad, Kobo, we need to convert prc to mobi.

\--After converted from prc to mobi, we can enjoy one book between multiple devices.

\--When removing drm from prc books, we have to convert prc to mobi.

\--PRC books provide us more metadata, images, writter information, etc.

### How to convert prc to mobi

There are many methods that can help us convert prc to mobi, but the common solutions are:

#### Method 2: Convert PRC to Mobi Calibre

Calibre is the best ebook management tool, supports many input formats and output formats. Free, and very easy to use. So I recommend it here for you to convert prc to mobi kindle. Download [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) please.

Step 1: Connect Android with PC to load prc files.

Step 2: Add prc files to Calibre, "Convert Books" to "Mobi"

But Calibre only supports DRM free files. Most of our purchased prc books are with DRM limitation, if we use calibre to convert prc to mobi, it will pop-up a window like this:

So at this time we should remove drm from prc file.

### How to convert drm prc to mobi

The tool we needed: [Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It helps remove drm from kindle prc books, and then convert to drm free mobi.

Though our prc files are downloaded from Android or Kindle Fire, but here I don't recommend you transfer prc files from them, but sync prc with Kindle reading app. On your computer install the free kindle, log in with your own amazon account, then you will find all your purchased kindle books listed in this library. Regardless of which format they are, you just need to find what the books you want to convert. Truse me this solution is more easy to take action, and, of course if you still want to connect your android or kindle fire to find prc, don't worry this article [PRC DRM Removal for Kindle Android Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) is written for you.

Then get the ultimate tool started please. At the interface of upper right, you will see a "Kindle" icon, below it you will see your kindle files, of course your prc files also are included in. Drag and drop those files to the left, then drm removing job starts.

**Note:**

For synced kindle books, not all prc files below "Kindle" icon are with .prc extension, because now Amazon transform drm prc to azw or azw3\. But here don't mind what the formats are, you just need to find the books you want to convert.

Select common "Mobi" as output format, click on "Convert" button, waiting for the conversion.

It will be completed soon. OK, now you can transfer your mobi files to Kindle devices again, start your new journey. And, you can also transfer these non-drm mobi files to kindle app on your iPad, Kobo, Nexus 7, etc. And, you can also share mobi books with your friends, while prc files don't support.

2.Some physical discs use things like bad sectors, a type of copy protection scheme deliberately mixing bad sectors into the data with ARccOS coding and thereby confusing Handbrake or other common ripping software, if the discs are in good condition. These discs are generally produced by Sony. So even Handbrake finishes the ripping, it will produce unusable copies.

![A computer screen displaying ChatGPT's website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-generative-ai.jpg)

 It helps to start with understanding[what AI is, the dangers it poses](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-what-dangers-does-artificial-intelligence-pose/) , and how it can help you. Understanding the basics of AI and how it works will help you know its strengths and limitations, as well as how to use it to thrive in your workplace.

 In simple terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computer systems to simulate human intelligence and carry out a wide range of tasks. Some of the most common use cases of AI in the workplace include automating hiring processes, optimizing customer service, inventory management, or data collection and analysis, to name a few.

 Although AI systems have been used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and sales for quite some time, their use is increasing exponentially due to technological advancements and the release of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT.

 ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that relies on vast amounts of training data to generate natural-sounding text. This AI chatbot is used for tasks such as content creation, programming, and translation, to name a few. In fact, this tool is so good that[people wonder if generative AI will take over their jobs](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/) .

## 2\. Know the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence

 Having gained a basic understanding of what AI is and how it works, knowing how it compares to human intelligence will help you appreciate their limitations, discover how they can complement each other, and how you can use both to achieve your work goals.

 Human intelligence can be defined as the capacity to think, learn, and use information to solve problems or adapt to a new environment. Human intelligence relies on cognitive processes like perception, problem-solving, memory, and creativity. It can be limited by factors like the amount of information available or one's ability to recall information, cognitive biases, and limited attention spans.

 Although humans and artificial intelligence use data to solve problems, AI relies on complex algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of data at a higher pace without getting tired. AI-powered systems also have limited capabilities, as they rely on the set of instructions and the data fed into their systems to carry out tasks.

 On the other hand, humans possess the unique ability to use their senses and emotions and apply knowledge and logic in creative ways to solve complex problems.

## 3\. Develop Skills AI Can't Replicate

As such, it is vital to invest in future-proofing skills that AI can't replicate to survive and thrive in the AI-dominated workplace.

 Some of these AI-proof skills include empathy, creativity, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, resilience, communication, and collaboration skills. Investing in these skills will empower you to bring unique insights and solutions. Additionally, as AI solutions continuously improve, you can use your creativity to find innovative ways to use the technologies in your workplace.

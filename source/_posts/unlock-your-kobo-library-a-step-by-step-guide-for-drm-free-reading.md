After purchasing eBooks on Kobo books store, you may want to share them with your wife, friends, or read them on your other devices. But you can't share them because **the purchased books are protected by DRM**.

Following this guide, you can own the books you purchased and share them with your famlies and read them on any eReader, even print the pages out.

Quick Accesses:

* [**Universal method**: Remove Kobo DRM from **Adobe Digital Editions**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- If you use ADE to help manage files.
* [**Easy method**: Remove Kobo DRM from **Kobo desktop app**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- If you just have a Windows or Mac computer.
* **[Simplest method](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**[: Remove DRM from **Kobo eReader device**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- If you have a Kobo Glo or Kobo Aura.

As default, you have two ways to [download Kobo books to your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/): Sync to computer via Kobo desktop software, or download ACSM file from Kobo website, then use Adobe Digital Editions to convert ACSM to EPUB.

### Remove Kobo DRM with Epubor Ultimate \[Infographic\]

[![kobo drm removal infographic](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobo-drm-removal-infographic.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)

### Method 1: Remove DRM from Kobo eBooks via ADE

**1\. Download .acsm files from Kobo website**

Visit your [Kobo library](http://www.kobobooks.com/library/library.html), where you can see all the purchased books. On the right side of the cover, there are "Download EPUB" and "ADOBE DRM EPUB" buttons. "Download EPUB" button indicates this book is DRM-Free, while "Adobe DRM EPUB" indicates the book is encrypted.

Clicking **"ADOBE DRM EPUB"** button you can download an **.acsm** file, which is the link to get a complete EPUB book.

![kobo library](http://www.epubor.com/images/kobo-library.png)

**2\. Install ADE and convert acsm to EPUB**

Install [Adobe Digital Editions (ADE)](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html), and authorize your it with your adobe ID.

Drag the .acsm file into ADE, and you will see this read kobo ebooks are downloading.

![download kobo books with adobe digital editions](http://www.epubor.com/images/ade-download-kobo-books.png)

After the book is fulfilled, the EPUB file will be saved in "Documents/My Digital Editions", and you can remove DRM from this EPUB file.

**3\. Install Epubor Ultimate**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The software automatically scans your Adobe Digital Edition's content folder and imports all the books if you want. And all the imported books will be immediately decrypted. You can also manually drag the EPUB file into Adobe DRM Removal's main interface.

When the process has been finished, you can right click on an item and choose "Explore output folder", where saves the DRM-free books.

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Before decryption, please [make sure you can read them in Adobe Digital Editions](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), which is **very important** for your successful decryption.

This is a common-used method during a long time, yes? But the good news is that there are 2 easier methods provided for you, which saves your time to find your acsm files or kepub files, and even better, you don't have to use ADE and authorize with Adobe ID. You know, we are always meeting different kinds of problems when using ADE to dowloading ebooks.

### Method 2: Remove DRM from Kobo Desktop Win/Mac

**1\. Download Kobo desktop application and sync books.**

Download and install Kobo for PC/Mac here: <https://www.kobo.com/desktop>  

(Please note that Kobo desktop support has ended for Windows XP.)

After multiple attempts and while logged in as an Administrator, with a password, I'm still unable to install Adobe Digital Editions. Any suggestions? It seems that all the removal tools are dependent on ADE. Are there other DRM that affect ePub books for Kobo?

I have Adobe Digital Editions and can save books on my Kobo Touch no problem, as well, I can drop books onto my grandmother's Kobo, so this is great. My problem is that Adobe Digital Editions does not recognize the Kobo Vox (it doesn't show up as an option on the left hand side to ADE). So I d/l Caliber and copied all of my ebooks over. Caliber recognized the Vox no problem, but when I sent the books to the ereader, there was a problem with the import and none of the books will open. It says that they are DRM protected. Please help...

I have purchased 12 books from the Kobo store, for my Kobo Vox and I can't transfer them from my PC to the Kobo Vox reader. ADE does not recognize Kobo Vox. There is no icon to drop these books into.   
 When I purchase a title from my Kobo Vox it is saved with no problem. I will continue to purchase items this way but I really want the titles that I have already paid for and can't access.

Don't worry about it. As Kobo official site says, ADE supports all Kobo books. So your books might not be the ADE-supported version.

 Just take the following steps.  
 1\. Sign in at Kobo’s official site.  
 2\. Click “MY LIBRARY” on the top navigation bar and you will find all your purchased Kobo books.  
 3.Click “ADOBE DRM EPUB” on the right side of your book and an ACSM file will be downloaded to your computer.  
 4\. Drag the ACSM file to ADE. The EPUB book will be downloaded to your computer during this process, and make sure you can read it on ADE.

Hi,

 To print Kobo books, you need to make sure they are DRM free. If they are in EPUB format, you'd better convert them to PDF and then print them out.

I followed your directions for where to find the KOBO books stored on my apple computer, but there is no file "Kobo" in my "application support" folder. I've also done a search for "kepub" and "kobo" to find if it's somewhere else on my computer and nothing is coming up... Has Kobo changed how it stores books? My Kobo reader also does not look like your photo above. There is no "my library" it is only "my books." I am able to access my book offline, so I feel like it must be on my computer somewhere, but I cannot find where.

I found that epubor wouldn't "see" the files in the kepub directory, due to their not having a file type extension, but that if I dragged them into epubor from an external search window epubor then processed them just fine; a rather brute force approach, but it worked.

 In other words, while epubor didn't recognize them as being applicable to its search function as they didn't have a recognized file type extension, once it actually opened them up it could properly identify the internal structure of the files and process them.

Interesting.

 I'm not sure what made the difference this time, because now the Kobo materials do show up within the Kobo tab.

 Last time the "I'm doing stuff" swirly thing kept going forever and a day with no end, this time it was done in less than a minute.  
 Possibly had something to do with the update that installed when I ran ePubor today?

 This is good, since now I can see the names of the books, rather than the unintelligible character string Kobo uses as unique identifiers when viewing the directory in File Explorer. With 466 eBooks currently in that directory, this really makes a difference!

Hi,  
 When I drag most kepub files into the DRM removal window it shows that the file has been decrypted, but when opening the epub file in ADE it shows only the content headings to the left. It does open in calibre, but the file is just scrambled characters. About 1 in 20 files does actually decrypt and is readable. Could you please advise. I'm running the latest version of Kobo Desktop and the latest version of epubor.

## Discover the Premier 7 AI Prompt Services Online Today

 When you use an AI chatbot, the way to get what you want is with a clear prompt. However, crafting the perfect AI prompt for every situation is more difficult than it sounds, which is where AI prompt marketplaces come in.

 If you're looking to buy AI prompts or even sell some prompts of your own, you may find AI prompt marketplaces useful—but which is the best AI prompt platform?

## 1.[PromptBase](https://promptbase.com/)

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0"> vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External/Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.

![screenshot of promptbase website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-base-1.jpg)

 PromptBase offers over 100,000 AI prompts for various popular models, including MidJourney, DALL-E, ChatGPT, and Stable Diffusion. This doesn't stop at text prompts alone. PromptBase has logo and icon prompts, art prompts, gaming prompts, and photography prompts for all the creatives out there.

 But if you're looking for simpler prompts, PromptBase has your back. Maybe you're looking for prompts to boost your productivity, aid you in coding, or help you as a business owner. PromptBase provides prompts for all these areas across numerous models.

 To find the AI prompt you need, use PromptBase's search input tool or browse through the categories in the top bar menu on the website's homepage.

![screenshot of promptbase search results](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-base-2.jpg)

 Even when searching via category, you can filter your searches to narrow down the options based on your preferences.

 On top of this, PromptBase gives users the chance to sell their own prompts and hire individuals to create prompts. PromptBase has a wide range of prompt engineers to choose from, and you can view engineers based on the AI model they can develop prompts for. After clicking on the engineer's profile, you can see which prompts they currently have for sale, though you can message them if you're looking for something bespoke and specific.

 You can pay for prompts on PromptBase via the Stripe[online payment processor](https://www.makeuseof.com/payment-providers-for-react-paypal-stripe-square/) .

 To sell a prompt, PromptBase requires you to provide a prompt name, type, description, and price. Then, you'll need to directly paste your prompt into the provided box. PromptBase will test the prompt to see if it's legitimate, and if everything checks out, you can go ahead and list your prompt.

## 2.[PromptHero](https://prompthero.com/)

![prompthero website homepage screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-hero-1.jpg)

 PromptHero offers a fairly similar service to PromptBase. This prompt marketplace offers prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, Openjourney, and Stable Diffusion. These prompts can be used for all kinds of purposes, including photography, anime, architecture, fashion, interior design, logos, and icons. If you want a general browse, you can also take a look at PromptHero's Featured, Hot, New, and Top categories.

 PromptHero allows you to browse categories via the top menu bar, though you can also use the website's search engine for more specific results.

 PromptHero offers a premium version of its marketplace for $9 monthly. Without this premium subscription, you'll only be able to use 25 free prompt credits per month. With the subscription, your monthly prompt cap will be increased to 300.

 A particularly interesting feature offered by Prompt Hero is its Jobs section. This page lets you search for AI jobs, whether remote or in-house, which is great for those with skills in AI. You can use PromptHero to access the application portal for the job you desire, and you can also view the salary, contract term, or hourly rate.

## 3.[ChatX](https://chatx.ai/)

![screenshot of chatx website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chat-x-website.jpg)

 ChatX offers free and paid prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2\. When you arrive at the homepage of ChatX, you've got two options. You can head to the general prompt marketplace or ChatX's prompt generator. If you want to find preexisting prompts, head to the general prompt marketplace. If you want a specific prompt created on your behalf, head to the prompt generator.

 On ChatX's prompt marketplace, you can find prompts for ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. What's great is that many of ChatX's prompts are entirely free. You can find free image prompts, professional prompts, meal plan prompts, marketing prompts, art prompts, and more using this platform, so there's something for everyone. By either using the ChatX search bar or AI model categories, you can find the right prompt for you.

 On the other hand, if you opt for ChatX's ChatGPT or Midjourney prompt generator, you can have text-based prompts created on your behalf for free.

![chat x chatgpt prompt generator screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chat-x-generator.jpg)

 Simply describe what you want the AI model to act as and produce, and you'll be provided with a text prompt to download for future use.

## 4.[PromptSea](https://www.promptsea.io/)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png" border="0">Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![promptsea website homepage screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-sea-site.jpg)

 PromptSea isn't just an AI prompt marketplace but can certainly be used to find useful AI prompts. When you head to the PromptSea website, you won't be instantly met with the prompt marketplace. However, if you scroll down a little, you'll see a small number of featured AI prompts displayed. Click on the**Prompts** title, and you'll be taken to PromptSea's prompts platform. Here, you can find image prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALLE-2, Novel AI, Nightcafe, Jasper, and Niji Journey.

 It's important to note that PromptSea has an interesting twist: each prompt is a[non-fungible token (NFT)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft/) . This prevents prompts from being copied and resold without the correct authorization. These NFTs are stored on the Tezos, Polygon, or[BNB Chain](https://www.makeuseof.com/binance-bnb-chain/) blockchains.

<a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457" border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![screenshot of promptsea product purchase page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-sea-buy.jpg)

 On PromptSea, you can pay for prompts using cryptocurrencies such as Tezos, Polygon, or BNB. You can't use traditional tenders, such as dollars or pounds, to pay for digital items on PromptSea. If you're not a fan of crypto or NFTs, you may want to opt for one of the other marketplaces listed here.

## 5.[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/?ref=lgo)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![screenshot of promptsea website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/etsy-prompt-search.jpg)

 You may know Etsy as the prime platform for unique and handmade gifts, fashion, and homeware. But did you know Etsy also sells some useful AI prompts?

 Typing "AI prompts" in Etsy's search bar reveals the range of AI prompts for sale on the platform. You can find prompts for Midjourney, ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other AI models on Etsy, though these very often come in bundles. On the other prompt marketplaces discussed here, you can buy or generate a single prompt, but Etsy sellers sell prompts in packs of hundreds or even thousands.

So, how do you know what you're buying?

 When you see a prompt bundle you're interested in on Etsy, click on the listing and read the item details. This is crucial to determine what kind of prompts you're purchasing here. The title will likely indicate the type or theme of the prompts included, but you can usually access more information in the item details section.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png" border="0"> PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![highlighted item details section on etsy product page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/etsy-item-page-1.jpg)

 If you want to buy just a handful of AI prompts or something highly specific, Etsy may not be the right platform. Don't forget that Etsy isn't a dedicated AI prompt marketplace designed for finding and searching for prompts specifically.

## 6.[AIPRM](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aiprm-for-chatgpt/ojnbohmppadfgpejeebfnmnknjdlckgj)

![chatgpt interface with aiprm plugin active](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-aiprgm-plugin.jpg)

 AIPRM isn't a website-based marketplace. Rather, it is a free Chrome extension that lets you access useful ChatGPT prompts while using the ChatGPT interface.

 After installing the AIPRM plugin, connect your AIPRM account to your ChatGPT account. This lets AIPRM operate while you use ChatGPT. Once you've got this sorted, you can get started with AIPRM.

 While using AIPRM on ChatGPT, you'll notice that the normal chat page now has much more content. You'll see a myriad of suggested pitches and some search filters you can use to find the right prompt for you. You can filter prompts by topic, activity, GPT model, author name, prompt hint, and other factors. Alternatively, you can search for a prompt in the search bar on the right-hand side of the page.

 There are a few premium versions of AIPRM available, which lets you save your favorite prompts, hide prompts, create custom prompt lists, and much more. The extra features on offer depend on the kind of premium plan you go for. Currently, AIPRM offers the following premium tiers:

* **Plus:** $5/month
* **Pro:** $20/month
* **Elite:** $50/month
* **Titan:** $500/month

 Check out[AIPRM's plan information page](https://www.aiprm.com/blog/introducing-aiprm-premium-for-chatgpt/) to see what each tier offers.

## 7.[FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com/)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![screennshot of flowgpt website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flow-gpt-site.jpg)

 FlowGPT offers a range of useful AI services, including a prompt marketplace for ChatGPT users. FlowGPT's marketplace works a little differently from your standard prompt marketplace, with the option to actually interact with a wide range of AI chatbots using GPT.

 You can ask your chosen GPT-based bot to produce a prompt for you, though it's important to remember that specific bots are designed for specific kinds of prompts. For instance, if you want a job-hunting prompt, head to FlowGPT's job-hunting section.

 You can also create prompts on FlowGPT if you want to list your prompts for other users to access.

Question 1: _I've recorded a very large HD video which is about 30GB after editing in Final Cut Pro. I want to upload it to YouTube. When I compressed in 1280X720, the file was still very big and took ages to upload._

Answer: The upload speed is dependent on your video file size, except for internet bandwidth and upload traffic. it's recommended to rely on a YouTube video converter to make your video smaller in order to have YouTube uploads faster. 

Question 2: _"I recently uploaded a GoPro video on YouTube, but the video looks terrible and pixely to me even in 1080p. I'm wondering if YouTube's compression ruins my video, because I found a 1.05Gb file size reduction when I received from the download."_

Answer: Unloading a large-sized video might go awfully awry. This is because YouTube downscales your video heavily to a lower bitrate footage when uploading video, in order to fast stream video. That's why the video size is significantly smaller. However, this is achieved at the cost of drastic quality ruin. The video sometimes look like a trash. So you'd better compress video based on YouTube's recommended upload encoding settings.

## \[Basics\] YouTube Requirements for Video Uploading

Before you start to compress videos for YouTube, you may wonder what are the best [YouTube video compression settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)? Which file format can guarantee the highest video quality while being accepted by YouTube? To what extent should you resize video for YouTube upload limits? A basic understanding of the requirements on YouTube uploads will help to find the optimal balance point. 

**\* Source Video:**

Be sure the original source is good enough. You cannot expect miracles from bad video source. Since each video transcoding does reduce quality to some degree, even though you might enhance the bitrate that is closely related to quality. 

**\* File Size and Duration**

Videos within 15 minutes can be uploaded to YouTube by default. But you can share a video longer than 15 minutes for a verified account. And the maximum 20GB in size is allowed if using the latest browser. [See the detailed YouTube file size >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

**\* Video Formats and Codecs** 

On the list of [YouTube supported video formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) there are MOV, MP4, AVI, WMV, 3GP, FLV, MPEG, MKV, SWF. Any videos, from the video you just shot with your iPhone 4K camera, to your latest HD video production, can be uploaded to YouTube, however, you're suggested to compress video for YouTube in **MP4**  that features good size-quality tradeoff and is widely acceptable by media players and mobile devices. According to YouTube, the best video codec is **H.264**. Despite the next standard HEVC halves the file size while maintaining video quality even higher than H.264, Google doesn't make any plan to add HEVC into its support list. So we still recommend you to compress video in H.264 for better YouTube upload. 

**\* Bitrate:**

For a high-quality uploading, upping the bitrate to the highest level doesn't necessary mean you will get the highest possible quality, which instead gives rise to dramatic file size rising. Don't rely on heavy reduction because this will have the quality degrade significantly. Mostly, for 1080p video, the bitrate is suggested to **cut down to 8Mbps**, which is available to stream on most connections and is the approximate bitrate YouTube uses, especially for a relatively lower resolution. Be sure to use variable bitrate to make the video shrinking more efficient in such a way to resize YouTube videos in smaller size and reduce the bandwidth usage.

**\* Resolution:**

 Frankly, we suggest you compress video resolution to 1080p if possible. This is because video in 720p will be generated to a lower resolution that is bad for viewing, while 4k video will accordingly give rise to bitrate that will bring about bigger file size and makes youtube uploading slower. Whatever resolution you choose, make sure it's in accordance with the **16:9** aspect ratio players. For SD 16:9 widescreen video use 854x480, and for HD video use either 1280x720 or 1920x1080\. And 4k 3840x2160 video is also accepted. 

**\* Framerate:**

Keep the frame rate unchanged if necessary when you resize video since YouTube also suggests you to do the same thing. Any reduction of frame rate will lead to mosaic and video playback won't go smooth as before.

## Seamless Integration: Running Android Applications with WayDroid on Linux

### Key Takeaways

* WayDroid lets you launch a complete Android system on Linux with Google Play Services so you can install your favorite apps.
* You can install it on most major Linux distros, but be sure to choose the "GAPPS" Android type during WayDroid's setup. You'll also need to get your device certified by visiting Google's website.
* Once you're certified, launch WayDroid and open the Play Store to start installing apps.

 Looking to run Android apps on your Linux desktop? Learn how to use WayDroid to turn your Linux desktop or laptop into an Android app powerhouse.

##  What Is WayDroid?

 WayDroid is a container-based tool that allows for launching a complete Android system within the Linux desktop. It does this with Linux namespaces, effectively utilizing the Linux kernel. In simple terms, namespaces are a feature that helps isolate and separate parts of a computer so that it is possible to run each part independently as if it is the only one on the computer.

 If you're trying to run Android apps on Linux, WayDroid is the way to do it, and former "Android on Linux" tools [like Anbox](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/a-full-review-for-itools-virtual-location-and-top-5-alternatives-for-apple-iphone-8ipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) recommend it. WayDroid is compatible with a wide variety of Linux distributions and CPU architectures. Additionally, it harnesses Android's Mesa technology to enable efficient GPU pass-through from the container to the host system, which enhances the performance of graphical applications, ensuring a smooth user experience.

###  Installing Android Apps with WayDroid on Linux

 To enjoy Android apps on Linux through WayDroid, first open WayDroid from the Linux application menu. The "Initialize Waydroid" window will appear on the first launch. When the "Initialize WayDroid" window is open, navigate to the "Android Type" option and choose "GAPPS" to integrate [Google Play Services](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/top-11-free-movie-downloading-websites-you-should-know-about/). Hit the "Download" button to begin downloading and installing your Android container. This might take a while, so patience is key.

![The WayDroid initialization wizard on Ubuntu, showing the download options.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/waydroid-init.png) 

 After installation, click "Done" in the "Initialize WayDroid" window to start WayDroid Android. Upon the first startup, a notification may indicate that the device isnâ€™t certified to run Google Play apps. You now need to certify your Android device. Certification is required, as without it, you cannot install Android applications on WayDroid via the Google Play Store.

 Open a terminal and enter **sudo waydroid shell**. Execute the command to display your device's Android ID:

ANDROID_RUNTIME_ROOT=/apex/com.android.runtime ANDROID_DATA=/data ANDROID_TZDATA_ROOT=/apex/com.android.tzdata ANDROID_I18N_ROOT=/apex/com.android.i18n sqlite3 /data/data/com.google.android.gsf/databases/gservices.db "select * from main where name = 'android_id';"

 After you've found your ID, you need to submit it to Google for device verification purposes. To do this, visit the [Google "Uncertified" page](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified) and enter the code shown in your terminal. With your Android device registered with Google, restart WayDroid using the terminal commands **waydroid session stop** and then **waydroid session start** following that.

 You can now install Android apps. To start, open the Play Store app within WayDroid, sign in with your Google account.

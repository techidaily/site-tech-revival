I strongly recommend that someone with a working knowledge of English grammar and spelling check what you plan to put on your web site before you post it. The number of errors in the above page is most distracting from the message you are trying to convey.

Hello Norma,  
 You have to go on the amazon site and download on a PC the file "kindle all new paperwhite 5.15.1" then transfer this file on your kindle root directory using an USB cable. Then in the kindle menu choose "update the kindle". after restarting it should be ok.  
 Best regards

Thank you !  
 I applied your method for a manual ugrade and it was successful.  
 However, I dowloaded from the maker site the last upgrade for Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation. I think this could solve the problem for Norma.  
 Best regards

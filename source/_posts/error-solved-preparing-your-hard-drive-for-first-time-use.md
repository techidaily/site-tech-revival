 If you still don’t see improvement in Skyrim FPS, proceed to the second fix below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is essential to a smooth and enhanced gaming experience. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re more likely to get Skyrim FPS drops. So to avoid this, you should check for the driver updates regularly.

There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually:** If you know the exact model of your graphics card, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website:[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) . Then search for the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Once completed, launch Skyrim to test. If the FPS is not improved, there are a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Roll back your AMD graphics driver

 AMD users reported the latest AMD graphics driver can trigger decreased performance in Skyrim. To see if that’s the cause, you could roll back your graphics driver to the previous version.

 DDU is a solid fix for driver installation problems but it might not work for all cases. To get rid of potential risk, you’d better[create a restore point](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) beforehand.

Here is the instruction:

1. Download and install[Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) .
2. Restart your computer in[Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
3. Launch DDU and select**GPU** and your**graphics card brand** on the main screen.

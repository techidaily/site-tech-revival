### Fix 1 – Restart the Oculus VR Runtime service

 When Oculus fails to communicate with its core service, the ‘can’t reach oculus runtime service’ error will appear and you might not be able to use your controller normally. In this case, you need to restart the Oculus Runtime service. Here is how:

 Once it’s done, restart your Oculus app to see if the controller works. If not, move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Turn off USB selective suspend

 USB selective suspend is a Windows feature that puts certain USB ports in the suspend state to save your computer from using unnecessary power. However, it might cause your Oculus VR rig to stop working randomly.

To disable USB power saving, follow the steps below:

1. Type**power plan** in the Windows search box and click**Edit power plan** .

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .

### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 Drivers matter a lot to the performance of your devices. To keep your VR rig up and running and gain the most smooth experience with Oculus Rift, Rift S or Quest, you should install the latest device drivers on your computer all the time.

There are mainly two ways to update the drivers for your Oculus devices:

**Option 1 – Manually** : You can search for the most recent Oculus driver from its **[support page](https://support.oculus.com/)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

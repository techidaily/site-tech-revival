JDcom and Boyue jointly launched the second Chinese made eReader – **JDRead Venus** on March 15, 2017\. It’s also called **Boyue Likebook Air** in North America and Europe. The product is primarily designed for Chinese users. It is defined to be a flagship Chinese pocket eReader which has better render effect on Chinese characters than Kindle eReaders do. It runs a newer version of **Android 4.4.2** on i.MX.6 SoloLite single core 1 GHZ CPU. The open Andriod system supports to install third party apps from Google Play which brings more playability to users. It has 1GB of RAM, 16GB of storage space, and an SD card slot to expand the storage further. It features a 6-inch 300 PPI E-ink Carta screen with a frontlight which enables you to read in the dark. Its battery capacity is 2000mAh which allows you to read with it constantly for about 25 days. The built-in reading app supports **ePub, MOBI, PDF, TXT, FB2, DOC, and HTML** files. It has massive digital resources that you can access and purchase books directly from the device anytime anywhere. So it’s enticing to millions of people including the ones who don’t settle down in mainland China.

 In this article, I’ll unveil and illustrate some **tips and trips of Likebook Air** which facilities your usage experience and helps you to make the most of the product.

[(3) Import books into Likebook Air](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) 

### Quick Access functions

#### 1\. Reading light quick start

Touch and hold the virtual HOME key for 5 seconds to turn the reading light on. If you want to turn the light off, just touch and hold HOME again for another 5 seconds.

#### 2\. Image retention removal

Sometimes partial refresh may results in image retention of previous page to be reflected in the current page (it occurs mostly when you set to refresh every 10 pages). You just need to press HOME key and hold for 2 seconds to start refresh, then the image retention is removed.

![no-image-retention](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/2-no-image-retention.png)

#### 3\. Toggle between page-turning keys

Sometimes you want to switch a hand to hold your eReader after you maintain a pose to read for a long time. JDRead Venus is among the very few eReaders to take that into account. You can set page up with left key, page down with right key, or set page up with right key, page down with left key.

#### 4\. Disable touchscreen

Open a book, click the first icon on the ribbon to disable the touchscreen. Once the touchscreen is disabled, pages can only be turned by pressing the entity keys on either side. Then you don’t need to worry about the reading page is turned into the next page by accident when your fingers touch the screen unintentionally. You can touch and hold the screen center for 2 seconds to enable the touchscreen again.

![disable-touchscreen](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-disable-touchscreen.png)

#### 5\. PDF Cropping

Likebook Air supports PDF cropping and gray level upgrade. You can enjoy reading manga on the eReader with better user experience after cropped PDF edges.

### Other tips and tricks

#### 1\. Fast download ebooks

Normally you can search books in bookstore when your Likebook Air is connected to internet. It’s quite easy but the drawback is that the search is not very smooth. Due to the innate features of eReaders, the screen flashes when images come out during the search process. My suggestion is that you can download a JDRead App in your mobile phone and sign up to the app with the same account as your Likebook Air. Download books and place them in bookshelf from your mobile phone. Then go back to your Likebook Air and read the books on the eReader.

#### 2\. Force restart

Sometimes your Likebook Air hangs and the images are frozen. You can’t pull out the battery and insert again to boot it up just like what you do with other Andriod devices. Under this circumstance, please press and hold all entity keys for 10 seconds, then a triangle icon appears in the screen. You just need to follow the normal boot-up procedure, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds, your Likebook Air will be booted up normally.

#### 3\. Change wallpaper

Put a wallpaper you want to use into system-screensaver.   
Swipe down from the top of the eReader, go to Settings;  
Tap Wallpaper setup, select custom wallpaper.

#### 2\. Import books with TF card

Likebook Air can access data in your micro TF card. So you can place some books in your TF card and insert the card into your eReader. The books will be scanned and imported to your Likebook Air from TF card automatically.

#### 3\. Transfer books via wifi

Likebook Air also supports book transfer from PC/mobile phone to the eReader via wifi. Make sure the wifi hotspot connected to the eReader is the same as the PC or mobile terminal network. Open the wifi transfer interface on your Likebook Air, scan the QR code in the main panel with your mobile phone, or input the given in the browser address bar on a computer. When landing to the wifi transfer webpage, select the books you want to transfer, wait for processing, then the books are uploaded successfully to your Likebook Air.

Hello - I have been reading about the Likebook Air and I like what I have seen so far. If I buy one, it would be used only as a calculator - specifically, as a spreadsheet device. Can anyone tell me if an android spreadsheet app such as Thomahawk's Simple Spreadsheet would work on the Air? Thank you. Jim

I have to ask two questions here.

 1\. Does it really have an TF card slot?  
 (it's never mentioned in the specs nor do I see a slot on the pictures)

 2\. Is it really running Android 4.4.2 or 4.2.2?  
 (4.4 is quite different from 4.2)

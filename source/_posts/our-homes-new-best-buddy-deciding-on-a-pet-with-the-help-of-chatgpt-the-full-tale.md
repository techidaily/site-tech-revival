## Our Home's New Best Buddy: Deciding on a Pet with the Help of ChatGPT - The Full Tale

### Key Takeaways

* Use ChatGPT for pet research, but double-check its answers, as it may suggest illegal pets like African Land Snails.
* Consider unique pets like frogs, hermit crabs, or finches that can coexist with existing animals in the household.

 What pet gets along with two cats, two dogs, nine chickens, a community of quail, three kids, and an axolotl? We're about to use ChatGPT to find out!

##  Planning for a New Pet

 My three sons and I are always on the lookout for new pets. They seem to find us without any assistance, but lately we've been feeling impatient for our next pet to appear. I thought perhaps this time we should do some research beforehand instead of stumbling onto a new pet like usual. We are a household that raises chickens and quail, and we foster through our local animal shelter a few times a year.

 We also keep two dogs, two cats, and an axolotl. My older kids want another exotic pet, but I'm thinking of something simpler. I don't want a small mammal, and I want something we can easily accommodate. What's a tech writer to do, but turn to ChatGPT? ChatGPT is an [AI-powered chatbot](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-how-to-find-free-sites-for-sound-effect-and-add-them-in-final-cut-pro-for-2024/) with a wealth of knowledge on all kinds of topics. ChatGPT [shouldn't be used for everything](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-comprehensible-explanation-of-youtubes-viewership-puzzle/), but it's good for research as long as you're willing to double-check its answers.

##  Prompt: What Is a Good Unusual Pet for my Family? Can Anything Live with Our Axolotl in His Cold Water Tank?

 I started with what I thought was an easy prompt. We once tried to give our axolotl (named Pixel) a fish friend. One morning, our fish friend was missing. However, since Pixel's skin is translucent, we were able to notice a fish-shaped shadow in their belly. We learned that fish too big for axolotls to eat might damage their sensitive gills, but any fish smaller than that will become lunch.

 ChatGPT started off with three simple suggestions: White Cloud Mountain Minnows, Ghost Shrimp, and Apple Snails. Of these suggestions, I'm certain Pixel could eat minnows and shrimp, but I hadn't considered apple snails. That might work! However, I think my kids were hoping for something a little more exciting. After the first three suggestions, ChatGPT went on to suggest other unusual pets that could be kept in a separate enclosure. These were:

* African Land Snail
* Frogs
* Insects
* Hermit Crabs
* Hedgehogs

![A screenshot of the list of ChatGPT's five alternative pets suggestions.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-26-000005.png) 

 It was difficult for me to make it through this list because I was horrified that it would suggest African Land Snails. I follow the exotic animal communities on social media and have learned that the African Land Snail is a significant invasive species. They're illegal to own, import, or transport in the US. That is a terrible suggestion! I've watched ChatGPT "grow up" as an AI and couldn't help but feel like it should have known better than that. To give it another chance, I asked "Are African Land Snails legal in the US?" I was pleased to see it warn against them, and suggest apple or garden snails as pets for those interested in snails.

 Regarding the other suggestions, I thought frogs were a good choice. However, we don't already own many frog habitat supplies. I love hermit crabs, and I'd love to get one to keep in the kitchen. However, I don't think my boys would be interested.

##  Prompt: What Pets Can Live with Chickens? We Have Nine Big Hens

 I think my kids are hoping for a reptile or insect. GPT suggested an insect, but I'm afraid my youngest would accidentally injure it. He is curious about bugs and knows no fear. Conversely, my big kids might be nervous about feeding it. Since we have chickens and quail, I was wondering if finches or other little flight birds could live up in the roof of their shed/coop. Unfortunately, I didn't specify this with GPT, and it suggested more farm animals. We have backyard chickens, not a farm. It would not be appropriate for us to have ducks, geese, or goats, GPT suggested.

##  Prompt: Do Any Cool Pets Eat Eggs? We Have a Surplus of Chicken and Quail Eggs

 ChatGPT gave 10 suggestions, which is more than I expected. I guess a lot of things eat eggs! The suggestions included:

* Snakes: African egg-eating snakes and monitor lizards
* Mammals: Ferrets and Skunks
* Birds: Crows, Ravens, Hawks, and Owls

 While some of these suggestions are a bit unusual, the prompt asked for "cool" pets. Unusual suggestions seem appropriate. To my knowledge, none of the suggestions are illegal at the federal level in the US, like African Land Snails. I know at least monitor lizards are illegal to keep as pets in my state, but it did end the suggestion by reminding me to check legal restrictions in your area. I do not want any more mammals, and the suggested birds are known predators of quail. They also require a lot of training. However, African egg-eating snakes have been on my radar for a long time. I'd forgotten about them, but this might be a useful suggestion!

##  Prompt: Tell Me More About the African Egg-Eating Snake as a Pet in the US

![A screenshot of the housing, diet, and behavior of the snake provided by ChatGPT](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-26-000400.png)

 ChatGPT did a great job explaining the housing, diet, habitat, behavior, and health needs of this snake. They are docile, have no teeth, are small, and are easy to handle. They eat finch eggs as juveniles and quickly move to quail eggs as adults. Sounds perfect for us, if we can find one.

##  The Big Omission

 This snake is not found in pet stores and reptile traders rarely carry them. Therefore, I would not expect GPT to have a lot of information on them. However, even though this snake is not endangered, it is at least questionable if it is ethical to purchase wild-caught snakes. Wild-caught snakes can refuse to eat and starve themselves due to stress, or come with diseases prevalent in the wild. Our Axolotl is captive-bred for some of the same reasons. I would have liked to see GPT at least mention the difference.

##  Our Final Decision

 This experiment has motivated me to get some snails for our Axolotl, a hermit crab for the kitchen, and finches! We have experience with these little birds and already have appropriate cages. While zebra finches are the most popular, I have always enjoyed the complex social interactions of society finches. They have such strong personalities and a pleasant song. More importantly, they lay the right-sized eggs for a juvenile egg-eating snake! Should we ever come across one, we will already have the eggs needed to raise it. Apart from the African Land Snail debacle, ChatGPT did better than I expected with this project. I've already let ChatGPT [plan a vacation](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visual-impact-seamlessly-add-photos-to-your-instagram-account/). I only see myself incorporating AI into more of our family projects.

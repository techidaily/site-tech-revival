### Why People Choose to Read Kindle Books on PC Rather than on eReader? 

There are several reasons why people choose to read kindle books on computer:

* **Cost:** If you have a computer already, you don't need to invest in a separate eReader device. Many people already own a computer, so they can access ebooks without an additional expense.
* **Versatility:** Computers offer a wide range of applications and software that can be used to read ebooks. This versatility can be appealing to those who want to use the same device for various tasks, such as work, entertainment, and reading.
* **Large Screen:** A computer typically has a larger screen than most eReaders, which can be beneficial for those who prefer larger text or images, especially if they have visual impairments.
* **Multi-Tasking:** Computers allow for multitasking. You can switch between reading an ebook and performing other tasks, such as research, work, or communication, more easily than on an eReader.
* **Connectivity:** Computers are always connected to the internet, which makes it easy to access online content and research while reading. You can quickly look up references, check facts, or interact with online communities related to the book you're reading.
* **Compatibility:** Some kindle ebook formats may not be supported by all eReaders. Many kindle books are only available on the latest kindle for PC/Mac, not on eReader.
* **Screen Quality:** High-end computers often have superior display quality and resolution compared to eReaders, making for a more visually appealing reading experience.
* **Storage and Backup:** Ebooks on a computer can be easily backed up and stored in the cloud or external drives, reducing the risk of losing your entire library due to a device malfunction.

Or you just don't own any kindle device. 

Compared with the eReaders or tablets, computers enablves you to read eBooks in full-screen which is excellent experience for reading graphic novels or comics. An important reason that scholars or students choose to read Kindle books on PC or Mac may be because it is much easier to reference texts in their works.

### Final Thoughts

Now I've shared three different methods to read kindle books on Windows PC. You can read kindle books on PC online and offline without any hassle now. However, different people have different reading habits. 

According to my personal reading habits, I always prefer to keep my purchased eBooks in one reader app because it is much easier for me to manage a large collection of ebooks within a single library, rather than different reading apps for each ebook vendors. This is one of the reasons why I strongly recommend removing Kindle DRM and reading Kindle eBooks with your favorite reading apps.

Another reason is that reading Kindle books with non-Kindle apps means I can get my Kindle books in DRM-free format. Consequently, I can back up these books to my computer, no matter what happens to Amazon or my Amazon account. It is a way of safeguarding my Kindle books.

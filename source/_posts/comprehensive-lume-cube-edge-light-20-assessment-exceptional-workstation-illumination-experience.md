##  The Lume Cube Edge Light 2.0 Doubles as a Desk and Camera Light

 At my main desk, I have the [Elgato Ring Light](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-a-previously-synced-google-account-from-your-google-pixel-8-by-drfone-android/), which I love when doing video interviews, recording content, and more. But, it’s really _just_ a video light, and not much more. The Lume Cube I was expecting to be the exact opposite: desk light and not for videos. But, it surprised me. The Edge Light 2.0 is such a soft light that it doesn’t hurt to be in front of your eyes, similar to a quality ring light. It provides _very_ soft light, so there are no harsh shadows at all when you’re on camera.

 Then, whenever the camera turns off, simply use one of the five pivot points on the light and re-aim it back at your desk. Drop the brightness some (or raise it), and you’re good to go. This light serves a dual purpose at your desk, and if you can only afford one (either in cost or space), then I’d highly recommend going with the Lume Cube Edge Light 2.0.

 The light that shines down on my workspace is perfect for when I’m crafting or assembling projects. When not writing here, I run a small business where I make custom t-shirts and assemble laser-cut components, The Edge Light 2.0 is perfect for that, as it gives me a nice, balanced, shadow-free light on the desk exactly where I need it.

##  Adjustable Brightness and Color Temperatures Are Nice but Could Use Some Work

![Close up of the power button and lighting controls on the Lume Cube Edge Light 2](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/close-up-of-the-power-button-and-lighting-controls-on-the-lume-cube-edge-light-2jpg_53531150915_o.jpg)

 One of the highlight features of this desk light is the ability to change the brightness and color temperature at the touch of a button. The feature works well. Simply tap (or hold) the separate up or down buttons for both brightness and color temperature and the light changes accordingly.

 For color temperature, you can choose anywhere between 2700K and 7500K, letting you pick between a very warm or very cool white. I have it in the 3000K neighborhood as that’s what I have my home’s color temperature at. But, I can’t quite get the light to be _exactly_ 3000K, as it’s more of a guessing game. Needless to say, I wish that there were either fixed stops or a way to dial in the temperature, as guessing is fine for most situations, but I wish I could be more exact in dialing in the color temperature.

 Brightness is a bit along the same lines. You can somewhat step it up and down, but it’s hard to get it dialed in. A display built into the stand would be very convenient here, which could showcase both the brightness percentage as well as the color temperature, so you can get things set where you want them.

 The optional base gives you a similar feature, as there’s a slider there that lets you somewhat see where the color temperature (or brightness) falls on a scale of 2700K (1%) to 7500K (100%). But, it’s still not as precise as I’d like to see it. Comparing the Edge Light 2.0 back to the Elgato Ring Light that I’ve already got at my desk, I can use PC- or Mac-based software to choose a specific color temperature or brightness for repeatability every time, and that’s something I wish was available here.

##  Built-in USB Ports Make for Convenient Charging, Albeit Slow

![The Lumecube Edgelight 2.0 comes an additional USB-C and USB-A port](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-lumecube-edgelight-20-comes-an-additional-usb-c-and-usb-a-portjpg_53530911718_o.jpg)

 On the back of the Lume Cube Edge Light 2.0, you’ll find both a USB-A and USB-C port. This makes the light not only great for illuminating either you or your desk, but also for powering your gear. Both ports aren’t the fastest in the bunch, clocking in at around 10W or so, but that’s plenty to keep your phone or watch charged while working.

 Both the USB-A and USB-C ports are powered through the light’s standard power supply, meaning that your light and both charging ports are using up just a single wall outlet. This is convenient, low-profile, and multi-functional, everything I’m looking for in a minimal office.

##  Should You Buy the Lume Cube Edge Light 2.0?

![The Edgelight 2.0 is fully adjustable](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-edgelight-20-is-fully-adjustablejpg_53531037379_o.jpg)

 The [Lume Cube Edge Light 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/LUME-CUBE-Adjustable-Temperature-Brightness/dp/B0CN7BK69P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003040&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flume-cube-edge-light-20-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is something that should be in just about every modern office. It’s often hard to find quality desk light that will give shadow-free illumination at a variety of color temperatures. The Edge Light 2.0 delivers in spades here. Plus, the fact that it can double as a webcam light is even better.

 The only “downside” is the price. Amazon is full of desk lamps for sub-$50, and many in the sub-$30 range. Some of these lamps even include changeable color temperatures and brightness. Sure, they won’t be quite as soft as the Edge Light 2.0, there are not nearly as many positions to place the head in, and the built-in USB ports are often just 5W. But, with the Edge Light 2.0 coming in at nearly nine times the cost of [this desk light](https://www.amazon.com/Eye-Caring-Protects-Brightness-Adjustable-White/dp/B0868HY623?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003040&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flume-cube-edge-light-20-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), for those on a budget, it’ll be a hard sell.

![A Screenshot of Decktopus AI s Generative Presentation Tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/decktopus-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 Decktopus is an AI-powered presentation generator that aims to simplify the process of making presentations for any situation, and getting started with it couldn't be easier. All you have to do is type out a description of what you want your presentation to be about. If you’re not sure, Decktopus can often provide some useful suggestions.

 From there, Decktopus will help ask you several questions to generate a presentation tailored to your needs. Who the presentation is aimed at, what the aim of the presentation is, how long you want to be presenting for, and what template to use for the presentation are all questions you may receive.

 Each of these questions comes with several pre-generated responses, but you can always input your own by typing out what it is that you want. Then, Decktopus will then have your presentation entirely generated based on your inputs. The results look good on their own, but you can also adjust the themes and colors.

 On top of this, Decktopus also generates multiple layouts for its slides, so you can adjust it that way. If you really don’t like what Decktopus has created, you can also regenerate the presentation in its entirety to get a new AI response.

![A Screenshot of the SlidesAI io Google Slides Add-on](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/slides-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 If you’re looking for an AI presentation generator that works directly within Google Slides, then you can’t go wrong with SlidesAI.io. That's because SlidesAI.io is a Google Workspace add-on.

 There are already Workspace add-ons that let you[use ChatGPT on Google Sheets and Google Docs](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-chatgpt-google-sheets/) , and SlidesAI.io aims to do the same by letting you use AI to generate entire presentations in Google Slides.

 With SlidesAI.io, all you have to do is enter some text for the add-on to work with. There's a character limit here for free users, though you can upgrade for a higher limit. The more words you use, the more consistent the results will be.

 Alternatively, you can ask SlidesAI.io to create a presentation using just a simple title. The process here is much the same. There are also options to customize the look of SlidesAI.io within the add-on, though you can always adjust the look using Google Slides' in-built tools as well if you so wish.

## 3.[Tome](https://tome.app/)

![A Screenshot of Tome s Generative Presentation Tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tome-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 If you’re looking for a comprehensive presentation tool full of features, then Tome might just be exactly what you’re looking for. Features such as custom themes, fonts, and logos, are all present with Tome. If you’re looking for collaborative tools or[how to make a presentation more interactive](https://www.makeuseof.com/make-presentations-interactive-google-slides-presenter-view/) , then you can find that too.

 Tome has a ton of features to make your own presentations from scratch, but where Tome really excels is in its AI features. At the bottom of the presentation generation interface, you can access a ton of AI features.

 This includes creating AI images to match your content, creating a new slide with your content, converting a document into a presentation, or simply making one from scratch. Tome works quickly and efficiently with these AI tools, and you can easily make impressive presentations in mere moments.

![A Screenshot of GPT PPT s Generative Presentation Tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gpt_ppt-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 If you’re looking for something that can quickly generate a functioning presentation or slide show, then GPT\_PPT is a great little tool for doing just that. To use GPT\_PPT, all you have to do is sign up and type out what you want your presentation to be. From there, GPT\_PPT will automatically create a brief PowerPoint covering the points that you laid out.

 As you might imagine, GPT\_PPT generates PowerPoint files. The results aren’t always the cleanest, and there’s no way to edit them from within the web page. Fortunately, you can always open them in PowerPoint to edit them yourself and tidy them up. If you already know some of[these advanced Microsoft PowerPoint features that everyone must know](https://www.makeuseof.com/advanced-microsoft-powerpoint-features/) , then making a stunning presentation out of them shouldn’t be hard.

![A Screenshot of Presentations AI s Generative Presentation Tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/presentations-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 Presentations.AI is an online presentation generation service that uses AI to create presentations for business. To get started, all you have to do is select an AI template, and Presentations.AI will handle the rest.

 There are plenty of templates to choose from, and each can be customized. You can tell the AI what your business offers and what company you work for to get better results. From there, Presentations.AI handles the rest. From the template, the content of the slides, and everything in between, Presentations.AI will create your presentation for you.

 If there’s anything you don’t like about the slides, there are options to change the type or style of the slides, and you can add points and edit what Presentations.AI has created as well.

## 6.[ChatBA](https://www.chatba.com)

![A Screenshot of ChatBA s AI Presentation Generator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatba-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 ChatBA is an online AI presentation generation tool that allows you to quickly and easily create a complete presentation on just about any topic. With ChatBA, all you have to do is input the topic that you want a presentation on and leave the rest to the AI.

 The options with ChatBA are somewhat limited, but good for quick and short use cases. The presentations generated tend to be under ten slides long, and there's no way to adjust the size in any way. If you're looking to adjust the look of your presentation, there are a variety of themes to choose from, but if you want to make any substantial changes, you'll have to do so manually.

 ChatBA supports exporting in both PPTX and PDF file types, which is great if you already work in PowerPoint or are looking to present directly and want a PDF that you can easily share or present from.

![A Screenshot of MagicSlides AI Presentation Generation](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/magicslides-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg)

 MagicSlides is a Google Slides add-on that aims to work like ChatGPT for your presentations. To use MagicSlides, all you have to do is enter your topic, though you can also include additional information such as reference material and instructions.

 You can also choose to include images, which the AI will choose from Pexels. These images are entirely free-to-use, and match the content of the slide decently enough. The presentations produced with MagicSlides are pretty good. The content is organized by dot points and feels natural.

 The looks, however, leave a little to be desired. There are options to adjust the theme when the presentation is generated, but they're not super easy to use. You can always use the theme features that are already present in Google Slides to fix this, however.

## Make a Presentation Like Never Before

 There are plenty of AI tools out there that can create presentations for you entirely from scratch. Whether you’re looking for a presentation you can bring up at your next meeting, a way to engage your colleagues, or just a faster way of making that next slideshow, there’s an AI presentation generator out there for you.

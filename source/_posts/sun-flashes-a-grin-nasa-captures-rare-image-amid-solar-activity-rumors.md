## Sun Flashes a Grin: NASA Captures Rare Image Amid Solar Activity Rumors

We're always talking about the idea of [robots becoming self-aware](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-future-ready-data-retention-selecting-excellent-cloud-providers/), but if the sun managed the feat, that'd be a far more frightening prospect.NASA snapped a shot of the sun on Wednesday, in which the giant ball of hot plasma seemed to be sporting a smile---hopefully for good reasons, and not because it's about to explode. It appeared to feature two gashes for eyes, a round pug nose, and a flaming smile down below.Related: [ISS Avoids Collision (and Having to Exchange Info) With Russian Space Junk](https://www.howtogeek.com/843809/iss-avoids-collision-and-having-to-exchange-info-with-russian-space-junk/)"Say cheese!" [NASA began its Tweet](https://twitter.com/NASASun/status/1585401697819656193?cxt=HHwWgoC8jbicvYAsAAAA). "Today, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the Sun "smiling."The happy sun resembled a pumpkin on fire or what a person might look like if they were still somehow smiling while drowning in lava. It's open to interpretation, obviously.The smile is apparently not due to the sun trying to get a role in a Pixar film. Instead, it appears to be a result of science. NASA [explains in the Tweet](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-optimizing-your-yt-ad-revenue-with-effective-monetization-audits/) thatÂ "Seen in ultraviolet light, these dark patches on the sun are known as coronal holes and are regions where fast solar wind gushes out into space."Related: [That's No Moon, That's an Ad](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-soften-image-periphery-with-circular-light-blend-photoshop-for-2024/)Launched as a NASA mission in 2010, theÂ [Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/) observes the sun with a goal of understanding the "solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems." And also spotting smiles, apparently.Meanwhile, the moon had the same blank expression on its face.

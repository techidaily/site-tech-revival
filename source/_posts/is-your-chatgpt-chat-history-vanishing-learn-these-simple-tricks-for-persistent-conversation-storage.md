 ChatGPT is supposed to save the conversations you have with the tool. If you find that the tool isn’t saving your conversations and you’re having to restart your chats each time, we have a few fixes that can resolve your problem. Let’s find out what these solutions are so you can resolve your issue.

##  Check Your Internet Connection

 The most common reason [ChatGPT has trouble saving your chats](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-vr-gear-and-technology/) is that your internet connection isn’t working. An inactive connection can’t send your full chat input to ChatGPT, causing the site to be unable to save your chats.

 In this case, check if your internet connection is working by [opening a new tab](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-google-play-location-on-nubia-z50-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) in your web browser and loading a site other than the OpenAI website. If your site won’t load, you have a connection problem.

 There are many ways to [resolve issues with your internet connection](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-warriors-pantheon-valhalla-rebirth-for-2024/). You can [reboot your router](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-centric-ringtone-websites-guide/), [fix your network adapter problems](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/integrating-bing-ai-chat-into-android-keyboards-step-by-step-guide/), or contact your internet service provider (ISP). Remember that you have to have a working and stable connection to access and [use all ChatGPT features](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-mastering-monetization-a-beginners-guide-to-facebook-revenue-for-2024/).

##  Turn On Chat History on ChatGPT

 If your internet connection is working fine, the next item to check is [ChatGPT’s save feature](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-clock-companion-for-wedding-planners-and-couples/). This is the feature that decides whether your conversations with the tool should be saved or not. If you or someone else has disabled this option, that may be why your chats aren’t saving.

 To check the option, in ChatGPT’s bottom-left corner, click your profile icon and choose "Settings." In the open window, select "Data Controls" and turn on the "Chat History & Training" option.

![Enable the "Chat History & Training" option.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-enable-chat-history-chatgpt.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After enabling the option, start a chat with the site and see if the site saves your conversation.

##  Log Out and Back Into Your ChatGPT Account

 If ChatGPT still isn’t saving your chats, your [login session with the site may be problematic](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/channel-catalysts-affiliates-aiding-budgeted-buzzers-for-2024/). One way to fix this issue is to sign out and back into your account on the site. This refreshes your login with the site and possibly resolves your issue.

 Note that you’ll need your username and password to log back into ChatGPT, so keep those details handy.

 To start, in ChatGPT’s bottom-left corner, click your profile icon and choose "Log Out."

![Select "Log Out."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-sign-out-chatgpt.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After logging out, sign back into your account on the site. Then, start a new chat and see if the site saves it.

##  Clear Your Web Browser Cache

 All your web browsers cache various web content to speed up your browsing experience. Sometimes, these cached files become corrupted, causing websites to malfunction. This may have happened with ChatGPT in your web browser.

 To combat that, clear your web browser’s cached files, and your issue should be resolved. And don't worry; you won't lose your browsing history, bookmarks, or saved passwords when you do that. And it’s easy to clear the cache in [Chrome](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-take-control-of-time-top-10-free-video-speed-manipulation-apps-for-mobile/), [Firefox](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-best-tools-to-hard-reset-vivo-g2-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/), and [Edge](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-clearing-tactics-for-youtubes-stored-video-queue/) web browsers (check out our guides for those browsers to learn how to perform the procedure).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Turn Off Your Web Browser Extensions

 If you’re using extensions in your web browser, it’s possible one or more of these extensions are causing interference with ChatGPT. This can lead to the site not saving your chats, preventing you from accessing your chat history.

 To verify that, turn off your browser extensions in [Chrome](https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/easy-instructions-for-performing-a-successful-chromecast-update/), [Firefox](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), or [Edge](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-bringing-text-to-life-3d-creation-in-photo/) and see if ChatGPT saves your chats. If the site saves your conversations after you’ve turned off your extensions, re-enable your extensions one at a time to find and remove the culprit extension.

##  Reset Your Web Browser

 If you still can’t get ChatGPT to save your chats, your web browser settings might be incorrect. You or someone else may have modified your browser settings in a way that they don’t work well with your sites, causing your issue.

 To fix that, reset your [Chrome](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-nubia-z50s-pro-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [Firefox](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-the-two-factor-authentication-from-apple-iphone-6-plus-by-drfone-ios/), or [Edge](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/conquer-the-art-of-quick-messages-using-your-ipad/) browser settings to the defaults. This erases your custom settings and brings factory setting values, so only do this if you've tried everything else.

##  If Nothing Works, Contact ChatGPT

 If you’ve tried all the above methods but to no avail, it’s possible [something’s off on ChatGPT’s end](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-the-secrets-of-discord/). In this case, it’s a good idea to get in touch with the site’s support team and explain your issue. The support team should be able to help you with this.

 To do that, in ChatGPT’s bottom-right corner, click the question mark icon. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to send the site your message.

![Click the question mark icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-contact-chatgpt-support.png)

What is MP4? How much do you know about [MP4 video format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or how to convert MP4 to HEVC? MP4 or MPEG-4 Part 14 is a container format which can be used to store video, audio and text. Common MP4 codecs include H.264, H.265/HEVC, MPEG4, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, VP8, VP9, MP3, AAC, PNG, JPEG and MPEG timed text. The widely supported video codecs of MP4 are H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10) and MPEG4\. Other video codecs are less used. 

As is known to all, H.264 is superior to MPEG4 no matter in compression rate or image quality. But, the new HEVC codec doubles the compression efficiency compared with H.264 and it can save 50% bit rate for the equal video quality. According to test, a video file encoded with H.264 is 1-3X larger than H.265\. That is to say, you need more storage space to store MP4 (H264/MPEG-4) video. This can perfectly explain why so many people wanna encode MP4 videos to HEVC/H.265 codec. And that's why this post is here, helping you decode any MP4 video to H.265 on Mac/Win in ultra fast speed and intact quality reserved.

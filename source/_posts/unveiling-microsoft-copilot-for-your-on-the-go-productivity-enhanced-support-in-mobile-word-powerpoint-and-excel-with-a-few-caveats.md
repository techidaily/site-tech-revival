## Unveiling Microsoft Copilot for Your On-the-Go Productivity: Enhanced Support in Mobile Word, PowerPoint, and Excel With a Few Caveats

Microsoft is pushing Copilot as one of its main products now. With good reason—we're in the middle of the generative AI revolution, and Microsoft is one of many companies that wants the whole cake for itself. The chatbot has made it to several Microsoft products now, including Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Edge, and even Windows. Now, though, it's landing on one more place for certain people: The mobile Microsoft 365 app. There's a big catch for now, though.

 Microsoft has just launched Copilot support for the Microsoft 365 app. With it, you can check out the full power of Copilot within the main Microsoft 365 experience, as well as from the mobile versions of 365 apps, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The desktop Office apps already added Copilot a while ago, so it was just a matter of time for it to also land on the mobile versions as well. You can use it as a straight chatbot, the way the Copilot app already allows, or you can make it assist you with tasks within the different Microsoft 365 apps.

 The big catch is that Microsoft is only rolling this out to business users and organizations at the moment. Despite the announcement being made far and wide, the feature is, for now, only available for people with a "Copilot license." Even the screenshot Microsoft put on this blog post says that "your personal _and company_ data are protected in this chat."

 The silver lining here is that this will probably come to every Microsoft 365 user, business or not, eventually. Perhaps [Copilot Pro](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-photoshop-facebackground-anonymity-guide/) users. After all, that's what happened with Copilot in the desktop Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook applications. Microsoft started testing Copilot in the desktop apps with a handful of companies [in March 2023](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/3-smart-and-simple-ways-to-change-home-address-on-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), before eventually extending it to all companies who paid extra [the following January](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/15/bringing-the-full-power-of-copilot-to-more-people-and-businesses/). Copilot Pro was also [introduced in January](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-photoshop-facebackground-anonymity-guide/), which brings most of the Copilot features to home users for $20 per month.

 In the meantime, if you happen to be in an organization that uses Copilot, you can check it out now—send your employer a message if you're not seeing it yet.

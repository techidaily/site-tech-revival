[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

I purchased the Epubor Ultimate licence (alan.aves@ampna.com.au) to remove Adept DRM from a PDF, but Epubor unable to remove the DRM. Has Adobe changed something and your product is not up to date? If so, is an update likely soon?  
 Thanks

I've followed the instructions here: https://epubor.com/remove-drm-from-adobe.html but so far I can't convert them to add to my eReader. I've tried a couple eBooks purchased from Kobo and keep getting 'Adept DRM' issues. Previously these books had converted fine but now I download them and so far no luck.

[Cover graphic distorted](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/31/2020 6:43:59 AM

[Cannot export google books to ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/15/2022 9:10:54 AM 

I've been using epubor for a while and I have exported around 50 ebooks from google play store to ADE and then successfully removed the DRM using epubor.

 Now, out of the blue, when I try to open an ascm file, ADE gives me the following error: 

 E\_ADEPT\_NO\_FULFILLMENT\_RESULT

 Google support and Adobe support have been unable to resolve the issue. Unless I fix this, I can no longer use epubor to remove DRM from google ebooks which I own.

 Has anyone seen this problem and does anybody have a solution?

Hi,

 I have installed the free trail and converted an Adobe DE ePub. It turns out just flat text without pictures / book cover etcetra. Is this correct? Is this due to the free trial, or is this "just what it is"?

 Thx!

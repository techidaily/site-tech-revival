While iPhone storage goes up to 512GB, the iOS backups users create become larger. This leads to a heavier burden on the disk space of computers, especially Macs, most of which have very limited storage like 250GB or so. For example, users may have seen the message saying "iPhone restore cannot be saved because of not enough space on the computer". Besides, a full storage will result in slow performance on the computer. To protect iPhone data and avoid any lags on the computer at the same time, we will need to backup iPhone to a USB drive. Today this post will show you how to backup iPhone to an external hard drive on Windows & Mac.

This guide works for macOS Big Sur and ealier and Windows 10/8/7/XP.

## Method 1: Copy iTunes Backup to External Hard Drive 

First of all, connect your external hard drive to the computer and create a new folder to save the backup. Now let's go.

### Step 1: Locate the iTunes backup

Find the iTunes backup folder on your computer:

\* On a Mac, it's saved in /Users/\[username\]/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup.  
 Or you can open a new Finder window and tap Command+Shift+G and enter \~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup to find the Backup folder quickly.  
 \* On Windows, it's saved in C:\\Users\\\[Username\]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup  
 Or you can open Run (Windows 7 and earlier) or Search (Windows 8/10) > type %appdata% (with the percents) and press return. From Application Data, navigate to Apple Computer > MobileSync > Backup to find the folder quickly.

### Step 2: Copy iPhone backup to external hard drive

After you find the Backup folder, copy it to the new folder you just created on the USB drive and wait for the transfer to complete. After the Backup folder is moved to the external drive, now back to the original location of the Backup folder on the computer and rename the Backup to Backup-Old or delete it (we suggest you delete it after Step 3).

### Step 3: Change iTunes backup location to the USB drive 

In this step, we'll create a symlink or symbolic link to make a new location for iTunes to backup iPhone, namely, set the external hard drive as the new location for iTunes backup. 

\* On Mac, Launch the Terminal in /Applications/Utilities/ and type in the following command:  
 ln -s /Volumes/\[your hard drive name\]/\[backup folder name\]/Backup/ \~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup  
 \* On Windows, run Command Prompt as administrator and type the following command and press Enter:  
 mklink /J "C:\\Users\\\[Username\]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup" "\[your hard drive name\]:\\ \[backup folder name\]"

Hit return and quit Terminal. Go back to \~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/ folder in Finder (or the path on Windows) and you can see the Backup folder is now a blank icon with an arrow on it. It means you have changed the iTunes backup location and further iPhone will be backed up to the external drive via iTunes.

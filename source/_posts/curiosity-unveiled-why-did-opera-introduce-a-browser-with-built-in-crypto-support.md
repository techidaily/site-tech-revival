## Curiosity Unveiled: Why Did Opera Introduce a Browser with Built-In Crypto Support?

Opera has just [released](https://blogs.opera.com/crypto/2022/01/opera-crypto-browser-project-web3/) a beta version of a new browser dedicated to all things [cryptocurrency](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-drfone-by-drfone-android/). It's not something anyone was asking for, but it does seem to have some useful features for people heavily invested in the crypto scene.

 As far as what made Opera decide to release a [cryptocurrency](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-itel-p40plus-phones-by-drfone-android/) browser, the company broke down its thought process in a lengthy [blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/crypto/2022/01/opera-crypto-browser-project-web3/). The company said, "The Opera Crypto Browser Project is about more than just surfing traditional websites through a one-size-fits-all solution. It's specifically designed to work with a variety of decentralized apps, or dApps, as well as provide deeper functionality than a traditional browser that has a basic web wallet add-on."

 Basically, it's all about bringing the features you'd typically need add-ons to get. It also adds decentralized apps straight to the browser without installing anything. It comes with a built-in non-custodial wallet that will support blockchains including [Ethereum](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-automated-opener-your-srt-files-windows-and-mac/), [Bitcoin](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-are-location-permissions-life360-on-vivo-y17s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), Celo, and Nervos right away. It also has features like a secure clipboard, full support for Web3, and more.

 We'll have to wait and see if an idea like this catches on, but it seems like a smart move for Opera, who already released a [gaming browser](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-youtube-settings-to-eliminate-video-skips/) at one point, as it lets the company get ahead of the curve in terms of offering something like this to the crypto enthusiasts.

 The beta of the new browser is available now for [PC, Mac, and Android](https://blogs.opera.com/crypto/2022/01/opera-crypto-browser-project-web3/) (iOS is coming soon). If you're a big fan of investing in crypto, you can download it and see if the extra features it offers are worth it for you.

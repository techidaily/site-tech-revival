If we are eBook fans, we may find books we downloaded online are always with Amazon Kindle format, Mobi, AZW, EPUB and PDF format.  

**Mobi:**  Mobi is the format used by ?MobiPocket Reader?and?Amazon Kindle?Readers. It's cross-platform. eBooks in this format can also have both .Mobi and .PRC extension. It can only be read on Kindle devices and Kindle app, which don't support EPUB files.

**AZW:** AZW was released by Amazon in late 2011\. It is the successor to the Mobi?format, and has been updated to include a variety of new features and function. It's used only on the?Amazon Kindle?and Kindle app that are not compatible with EPUB format.

**PDF:** PDF is a commonly used format. It is widely used by a large number of retailers. eBooks with this format can be read on most of the eBook Reader, such as Kobo, Nook, Sony and Google.

**EPUB:** The EPUB format has become an industry-wide standard for eBooks. It is used by Barnes & Noble, Sony, Kobo, Google Play and many other eBook stores. The only regret is that it's not supported by Kindle.

Or click "Setting" icon at the right corner of this software to set our eBook path, and tap "Browse" button to select the folder which saves our eBooks. Then all the books will show up in the right side.

Hello,

 You can't directly deal with KFX extension until now, but here is an solution:

 Sycn the KFX extension books via Kindle for PC/Mac. If so, the synced books won't be .kfx but the .azw

 It's easy to deal with Kindle AZW books, right?

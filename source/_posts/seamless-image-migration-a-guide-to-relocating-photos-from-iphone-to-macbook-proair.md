iCloud service is so convenient and simple to use, and why we recommend it in the minor place? Generally because iCloud free storage is so limited, only 5GB. Thus, you have to pay more to get expansive space, 50GB, 200GB and 2TB premium options. Beyond that, iCloud errors like photos not uploading to iCloud, iCloud backup couldn't be completed occur now and then. And you also need to guarantee a high-speed network connection for photos (esp. 4K) downloading in bulk.

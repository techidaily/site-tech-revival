 I've been a regular user of VR for about five years now, and if there's one thing I really enjoy, it's a game that I can sink some time into. With headsets like the Oculus/Meta Quest, stepping into VR has never been easier. Here are three Quest-ready games you're sure to get your time and money's worth out of!

## 1  Blade & Sorcery: Nomad 

 I saved the best for _first_ in this instance, because this game is exactly the sort of thing you'd prescribe immediately to a friend who'd never heard of it. I am currently sitting on just under 300 hours clocked in this gem, and with the recent developments, I only see that number increasing steadily for the months to come. So, you ask, what's to rave about?

_Blade & Sorcery_ is the definitive medieval fantasy combat game in the VR sphere, boasting an "Overwhelmingly Positive" score on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/629730/Blade%5Fand%5FSorcery/), and after six years of development a 1.0 PCVR release has graced our headsets with all-new features and fun to be had. There are two versions of the game, one made for PCVR ($29.99) and the other, the Nomad edition ($19.99), optimized for Quest headsets, such as the new [Meta Quest 3](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-music-from-xiaomi-civi-3-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/).

 The official 1.0 release of Nomad isn't quite ready yet, but if you have a Quest headset, you can still utilize the classic sandbox mode, wherein a few different maps offer various waves of enemies and weapons to wield against them, from swords, shields, and spears, to knives and maces, as well as bows & arrows. If that isn't enough, magic can also come to your aid, whether you need to toss a fireball, cast lightning, or fulfill your childhood dreams of using the force with a gravity spell.

 If you're rocking the Quest but can't stand the wait, you can purchase the PC version of _Blade & Sorcery_ and link your headset with either a physical link cable or an application like Virtual Desktop which will stream the game to your HMD. In this way, the headset acts only as a display while your PC does all the heavy lifting.

 The real kicker for this game, like many others, is its modding community. The replay value for this game is already incredibly high, but the mods just send it skyrocketing. A personal favorite of mine is the ["Outer Rim"](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/528?tab=files) mod by Nexus Mods user Kingo64\. I would argue, and I have no doubt the good people at WarpFrog studios would agree, that the mod content created for their game has been integral in propelling it to great commercial and recreational success.

 So, all this being said, if this is your first time hearing of this, I highly recommend placing this at the top of your VR priority list. I've spent countless nights pretending I was some popular fictional character in-game and acting out scenes from movies and television. Check out [_Blade & Sorcery: Nomad_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2031826350263349/) for the Quest as soon as you can!

## 2  Beat Saber 

 In the same realm of "whacking things with a stick" but in a different gear, I present to you: _Beat Saber_ ($29.99). It's kind of like _Guitar Hero_ with lightsabers, and because of that, the potential to sink endless hours into it is obvious. However, you won't be laid back in your bean bag chair for this one. Let me explain.

_Beat Saber_ was released by Beat Games in 2019, and ever since, it has been riding the wave of success thanks to it filling the hole for the rhythm genre in VR. Instead of wielding a miniature plastic guitar, you are thrust into a stage of neon lights and lasers, with each of your controllers becoming glowing sabers. The base game offers 32 different songs that will generate "beats" for you to slice and dice as they fly towards you under the headset. As difficulty increases, obstacles are introduced for the player to avoid, and you may find yourself doing all sorts of different moves and motions in order to achieve a perfect score.

Beat Games

 If you think this game sounds like a sweat-fest, you'd be absolutely right. It's no surprise then why _Beat Saber_ is often marketed as a good way to get in a workout. Don't assume the fun stops at the base game either, as this title offers around 200 DLC songs to expand your library, priced at $1.99 each. This includes some of my favorites, such as The Rolling Stones, Linkin Park, and Daft Punk! Just make sure you take care of your hardware after working up a sweat; here's how to [sanitize your headset](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-artists-guide-to-dynamic-palette-alteration/).

 Overall, [_Beat Saber_](http://www.meta.com/experiences/2448060205267927) is the quintessential game for music lovers, fitness enthusiasts, and even those looking for somewhere to start in VR. I've been known to use the game to warm up in the morning, as I feel it's great for getting you pumped and ready for the day.

## 3  The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners 

 Perhaps you're reading this article and thinking, "All that is fine and dandy, but I would kill for some _plot!_" Look no further than SkyDance Interactive's _The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners_. ($39.99 USD) That's right, I just name-dropped a major IP that has its own VR game!

 If you're like me, then you're also someone who was glued to their television every weekend watching AMC's hit series _The Walking Dead._ You may have thought, "Pshh, I could survive that. Easy." Well, now's your chance! Take a trip down to South Louisiana in the heart of New Orleans and immerse yourself in a VR experience like no other. Warring factions, armies of the undead, and dangerous disease lurk around every corner, so you must employ every tool in your arsenal to fight, climb, run, and hide from whatever ills you may face.

 As the story progresses, you will find that important decisions are thrust upon you, and what you decide to do will affect the course of the game. I admit I fall heavily for the "folk hero" typecast, so I'm usually trying to help out the little guys and beating up on the bullies. As far as all-around VR games go, this one is one of the best in my opinion, as it brings a little bit of everything to the table. I'm also a little biased because I like to visit New Orleans (in the "real world") and it can be surreal to see architecture and landmarks represented before your very eyes in the virtual environment. Hand me an axe and tell me I get to fight zombies there too? No problem!

[_Saints and Sinners_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2897337400373711) has it all, from a strong story and design (choices matter), to solid combat mechanics and a world that is 100% worth your time exploring. Even if you're not a fan of the TV series, this game is sure to provide you hours of entertainment and satisfaction, and may even sway you to give the show another chance. _Laissez les bons temps rouler!_

 As time crawls on and VR continues to receive attention from both the public and game developers, my total playtime will only expand upward and onward. With such a variety of possibilities, between pure action, fitness-savvy fun, and intense storytelling, I see more and more titles worth your time coming to a headset near you. After all, these are just a few of my favorites; there are countless others available right now, such as those on this list. You've heard my spiel, now get out there!

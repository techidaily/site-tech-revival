_Hi I would like to compress AVI file created from MATLAB. I have to extract audio samples and video frames separately, process them and synchronize them. I have processed the video frames using VideoWriter Command. The resulting file was 175 mb which runs less than a minute. Can you please let me know if there are any commands to make it smaller, or convert it to MPG ?_

With no further explanation, AVI files employ old video codec - M-JPEG with compression rate lower than H.264/MPEG-4, not to mention the latest [H.265/HEVC codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Thus, AVI size reduction makes sense because AVI files take up more space than MP4 or other file formats. Here top 4 ways to shrink AVI files are listed for your convenience, in view of numerous people demanding on less space occupation and unnecessary expenditure on additional storage and bandwidth charges while uploading to YouTube or so. Keep in mind you should probably start with the basics: concern for the degree of video quality loss after shrinking AVI and stress on the choice of a proper [AVI compressor software](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to reduce AVI file size.

## \[Solutions\] How to Compress AVI to Smaller File Size

**1\. Reset Parameters: Reduce Frame Rate, Bit Rate and Resolution**

I would like to inform you that the compression of AVI video via adjusting parameters will sacrifice some quality of AVI file. If you are pursuing good quality, just move to the next step to [downsize AVI with no quality loss](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

① It doesn't take a genius to know that the higher the **resolution**, the sharper the picture, but also the larger the file size will be. So you can lower the AVI resolution, for example from 1080p to 720p, to shrink AVI file size to about 2/5 of the original. And you also can [downscale 4k to 1080p](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

 ② The second way to downsize AVI file is to decease the **bitrate**, because lowering the bitrate will directly lead to the downsize of AVI file. Bear in mind lower too much bitrate will lead to quality loss. You'd better to keep bitrate between 1400 and 2000 kbps.

 ③ **Frame rate** has a big effect on the file size, too. Lower the frame rate of AVI video to 10-15 fps can reduce AVI file size by half to 2/3\. There's something you need to know that cutting down frame rate will affect the smoothness of AVI playback.

**2\. Change the AVI Compressor**

AVI codecs can greatly decrease AVI size to smaller while maximizing the quality. You can choose from various codecs from difference sources. But what matters is your audience must have codec the same as to the codec you use so as to uncompress and view AVI. For the widest compatibility, you can use Cinepak as AVI codec. While for good reduction and high quality, taking Xvid as your [video size converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is a good choice.

**3\. Change Format from AVI to MP4 or Smaller-sized Format**

Compared to AVI, MP4, WMV and FLV provides good quality with extremely small file sizes. MP4 is famous for wide compability with media players, mobile sand tablets. WMV is a popular choice for video email and storage on a PC. While FLV is the best format for web video apps. So it's advised to [compress AVI to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), WMV, FLV, or other small sized format as per your needs with the aid of an AVI video converter. For this purpose, there are vlc to resize avi to mp4, ffmpeg avi to mp4, Handbrake and more.

**4\. Cut and Crop AVI file**

Besides, it also can help you download videos free from YouTube, Facebook, Vevo, Vimeo and more 1000+ online sites in AVI, MKV, MOV, 3GP, 720P/1080P HD, 4K UHD, 3D and more for offline playback on QuickTime, Mac, Apple TV or iPhone iPad iPod devices.

As we know, Adobe Digital Editions is a powerful eBook reading app, we can view our PDF or EPUB books via it. But sometimes, we may have the need to print EPUB/PDF books from it, and read printed files like published paper books. After all, paper books will be more convenient for us in some situation. Therefore, printing Adobe Digital Editions books is necessary. But how to? Don't worry. Here is the detailed guide for you to print EPUB and PDF books from ADE. 

**Pro Tips: (Updated 2020)**: [Complete Guide to Print All Kinds of eBook, including Kindle/Kobo/Google Play/Nook Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Case 1\. Print Adobe Digital Editions Books Directly

The best situation is that Adobe Digital Editions allows you to print the ebook directly without any limitations.

Just open the Adobe digital Editions books, and select "File" from the top menu bar, then click on "Print" from the drop-down list. If the "Print" options is activated, you can print this book easily.

### Case 2\. Print DRM-proteced Adobe Digital Editions Books

 The fact that almost all books from ADE are always with Adobe DRM, which are not allowed to print.

So the first thing we need to do is to remove DRM from Adobe Digital Editions EPUB/PDF files. 

#### Step1: Remove DRM from Adobe Digital Editions books

Here I recommend you a powerful tool [Ultimate eBook Converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) which can help us decrypt books from Google Play, Kobo, Sony and Barnes & Noble with ease. As long as you can read books with ADE, this software can deal with these DRM-protected books.

**Remove Adobe DRM from EPUB/PDF files**

First, please make sure you can read your books with [ADE](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html), this helps the tool find the key to decrypt DRM-protected books. Then just launch Epubor Ultimate, if the books are saved in the default folder, it will detect and import all the downloaded books automatically for us. We can see them under "Adobe" icon. So convenient, isn't it?

If your books don't show up in the right panel of this program, you can also click "Add" button to import your books, or just drag books from the folder which saves your downloaded EPUB or PDF files to the tool. 

**Where is the default location of ADE books?**

**For Windows:** ...\\My Documents (Documents)\\My Digital Editions ...

**For Mac:** Users/Your computer name/Digital Editions ...

Once we drag the books from the right side to the left frame of this software, all the books will be decrypted soon. The word "decrypted" shows the book has been decrypted successfully.

#### **Step2: Convert Adobe Digital Editions books to PDF**

If your decrypted books are PDF format, you can just start printing these books. But if they are EPUB, here I advise you to convert EPUB to PDF for better print quality.

Luckily, with this tool, we need not to install another eBook Converter. It has both DRM decryption and eBook conversion features. So, after we have removed Adobe DRM from EPUB/PDF books, we can directly use this program to convert EPUB to PDF. Just select PDF as output format at the bottom corner and click "Convert to PDF" button to start converting format.

![select pdf as output format](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/select-pdf-as-output-format.png)

Once the conversion has been finished, "Succeeded" will aprear. Click on "Succeeded" will pop the folder stored your converted files.

#### Step3: Print Adobe DRM books

Everything is ready. Now we can print our converted PDF files from ADE. Just open your DRM-free PDF files with Adobe Digital Editions, select **"File">>Print**.Then a window below will show up, just select the printer, copies, pages and then click on "Print". All done. Your Adobe Digital Editions books will be printed.

Can you please describe your problem more clearly so that we can help you fix it? "Doesn't work" will not help anything if you want to get your problem fixed.

The PDF version cuts off the first couple of words of each sentence, making it impossible to read.

Isn’t it ironic that the tools that you use to connect can also make you feel more isolated? Instead of being a part of the problem, technology can be a part of the solution.</p><p> Enter ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s not just about answering your random trivia questions or setting reminders. It’s capable of lending an ear, offering advice, and as a result, making you feel less lonely. Before you roll your eyes, explore how you can use ChatGPT most effectively to combat loneliness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Prompt-Engineering-for-ChatGPT-Conversations"><a href="#Prompt-Engineering-for-ChatGPT-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT Conversations"></a>Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT Conversations</h2><p> You may have already used<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-ai-combat-loneliness/" >AI to combat loneliness <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/online-ai-chat-companions/" >online AI chat companions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be helpful tools when real interactions are limited.

As a large language model tool, it’s capable of mimicking many kinds of conversations.</p><p> The trick to using ChatGPT effectively to combat loneliness is in the prompt. Think of prompt engineering as the difference between asking someone, “How was your day?” versus “Tell me the most interesting thing that happened to you today.” The latter is bound to elicit a more engaging response. Similarly, with ChatGPT, the magic lies in the prompts.</p><p> Let’s dive into the range of personalities you can craft.

For starters, ChatGPT free users can only send around 16 GPT-4o messages within a three-hour period. Once you hit the message limit, ChatGPT will block access to GPT-4o.</p><p> Second, although GPT-4o is a fully multimodal AI model, it doesn’t support DALL-E image creation. While that is an unfortunate restriction, it’s also not a huge problem, as you can easily use Microsoft Copilot.</p><p> Free GPT-4o access comes with some excellent features, though. ChatGPT free users can use GPT-4o for web browsing searches and questions, data analysis, image analysis, and extensive file support. So, it brings many of the core features of the ChatGPT Plus tier to free users. It also allows free users to access custom GPTs, though these have the same limits as GPT-4o messaging (and free users cannot make custom GPTs, only interact with them).</p><h2 id="3-Perplexity-ai"><a href="#3-Perplexity-ai" class="headerlink" title="3.Perplexity.ai"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/perplexity-ai-pro-search-option.jpg"                      alt="perplexity ai pro search option"                ></p><p> Perplexity.ai is a very promising AI tool with the option to use GPT-4 for free.

If you have used the iOS version of ChatGPT, then you already know what to expect. Just as it felt right at home in Apple’s ecosystem, so too does it feel at home on Android. And because navigating and learning the in’s and out’s of the app only takes a few moments, you’ll be asking questions and getting AI-generated answers in no time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/chatgpt-android-overview.png"                      alt="Different screens of ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Do keep in mind that, as of July 2023, not every feature is available on Android. For example, ChatGPT Plus was not available upon release. When it’s available, it will be available for Premium subscribers as always. As for the perks? You can easily read your entire ChatGPT history (regardless of the platform you’ve used it on) and control the data of your account. You can even export the data to your device with a single tap.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-on-Android-The-Circle-Is-Now-Complete"><a href="#ChatGPT-on-Android-The-Circle-Is-Now-Complete" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT on Android: The Circle Is Now Complete"></a>ChatGPT on Android: The Circle Is Now Complete</h2><p> With ChatGPT now available on Android, OpenAI’s AI chatbot now feels like a wholly complete product.

Out of all of them, GPT4All is near the top.</p><p> There are many reasons to try it, like how GPT4All enables you to chat with your documents. No need to “train” it, use expensive servers, or dive into Python. You can simply “add your documents” to GPT4All as they are to “expand its knowledge pool” with your data.</p><p>Let’s see how you can install and use GPT4All on your Windows PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Use-GPT4All"><a href="#Why-Use-GPT4All" class="headerlink" title="Why Use GPT4All?"></a>Why Use GPT4All?</h2><p> There are many reasons to<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gpt4all-and-how-does-it-work/" >use GPT4All <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of an alternative, including ChatGPT.</p><ul><li>You can run GPT4All only using your PC’s CPU. No need for a powerful (and pricey) GPU with over a dozen GBs of VRAM (although it can help).</li><li>GPT4All is a fully-offline solution, so it’s available even when you don’t have access to the internet.</li><li>Being offline and working as a “local app” also means all data you share with it remains on your computer—its creators won’t “peek into your chats”.</li><li>Since it only relies on your PC, it won’t get slower, stop responding, or ignore your prompts, like ChatGPT when its servers are overloaded.</li><li>GPT4All allows you to add your documents to its “knowledge pool” effortlessly. It can then present information from them in its answers, turning it into a true personal assistant that “knows about your stuff” instead of a generic chatbot.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-This-Basically-Like-Installing-ChatGPT-Locally"><a href="#Is-This-Basically-Like-Installing-ChatGPT-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Is This Basically Like Installing ChatGPT Locally?"></a>Is This Basically Like Installing ChatGPT Locally?</h2><p> Whether you’re arguing with a chatbot or using a service like Copilot to help you write code effortlessly, you’re interacting with a large language model (LLM). If you’re unfamiliar with the term, check out our article on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >what LLMs are and how they work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The LLM “behind” ChatGPT is one of the most advanced models in the world… but it’s also large, demanding on resources, and totally proprietary. Thus, you cannot “install ChatGPT on your PC” because:</p><ul><li>As a closed-source solution, only its creators, Open AI, can access “its internals” and run it on their servers.</li><li>It’s so large and demanding that running it on consumer-level PC hardware is impossible.</li></ul><p> Still, you can install and use other LLMs through GPT4All on your PC, as long as they’re not too demanding on your CPU or they can fit in your GPU’s more limited VRAM.</p><p> Nvidia’s ecosystem for AI hardware acceleration is generally considered more mature. As a result, there’s more Nvidia-centric software for GPU-accelerated tasks, like video encoding and, now, Machine Learning. GPT4All is among the tools that “play nicer” with Nvidia’s GPUs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Install-GPT4All"><a href="#How-to-Install-GPT4All" class="headerlink" title="How to Install GPT4All"></a>How to Install GPT4All</h2><p> GPT4All is available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Missed-Out-on-Your-ChatGPT-Talks-Here’s-How-You-Can-Get-Them-Back"><a href="#Missed-Out-on-Your-ChatGPT-Talks-Here’s-How-You-Can-Get-Them-Back" class="headerlink" title="Missed Out on Your ChatGPT Talks? Here’s How You Can Get Them Back"></a>Missed Out on Your ChatGPT Talks? Here’s How You Can Get Them Back</h2><p> ChatGPT has taken the world by storm since its November 2022 launch. However, as millions of users worldwide flock to play around with OpenAI’s chatbot, it does show the occasional bug and glitch from time to time.One of ChatGPT’s best features is that it records any conversations you have with it, showing them in a neat history box to the left. However, sometimes ChatGPT’s history disappears, leaving you unable to access your ChatGPT conversations.</p><h2 id="What-Caused-the-ChatGPT-History-Loss"><a href="#What-Caused-the-ChatGPT-History-Loss" class="headerlink" title="What Caused the ChatGPT History Loss?"></a>What Caused the ChatGPT History Loss?</h2><p> OpenAI temporarily disabled the ChatGPT history feature in March 2023. This doesn’t mean your previous conversations have been deleted; they’re just unavailable while OpenAI’s development team works out bugs and other issues.</p><p> ChatGPT’s history feature was disabled because of a bug in an open-source library used by ChatGPT that allowed some users to see titles from other users’ chat history.</p><p> OpenAI’s internal investigation revealed that around 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus users might have their personal data revealed. Overall, the total number of users whose data was disclosed was “extremely low,” and the company contacted everyone affected by the issue.</p><p> As the company worked on fixing this issue, CEO Sam Altman tweeted that users won’t be able to access their ChatGPT history temporarily, which likely caused the extended outage for the feature.</p><p> Regardless, the issue has been fixed now, meaning you should see your chat history show up without a problem. However, if your ChatGPT history is gone, we’ve got a few fixes for you to try out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-the-ChatGPT-History-Feature-Doesn’t-Work"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-the-ChatGPT-History-Feature-Doesn’t-Work" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When the ChatGPT History Feature Doesn’t Work?"></a>What to Do When the ChatGPT History Feature Doesn’t Work?</h2><p> If you still can’t see your chat history on ChatGPT, here are six fixes you can try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Check-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Your Internet Connection"></a>1. Check Your Internet Connection</h3><p> As you likely already know, you need an active internet connection to use ChatGPT. You probably won’t see your previous chats if your internet is cut out during a chat session. A quick fix for this is to ensure that your internet connection is working on Wi-Fi or mobile data and reload the browser tab running the chatbot.</p><p> As a side note, disable any VPNs or Proxies you might use. Since OpenAI’s services are geo-restricted, using a VPN can hamper functionality on the website. Additionally, ChatGPT may have blocked your VPN provider, or the VPN itself might be adding delays or lag that can cause functionality on the site to break.</p><h3 id="2-Log-Out-and-Log-Back-In-Again"><a href="#2-Log-Out-and-Log-Back-In-Again" class="headerlink" title="2. Log Out and Log Back In Again"></a>2. Log Out and Log Back In Again</h3><p> There’s a good chance that the update to fix the issue might’ve messed up your saved browser session running ChatGPT. Simply logging out and logging back in again with your OpenAI account can fix the problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-plus-message-screen.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt plus message screen"                ></p><p> To log out, simply click the<strong>Log out</strong> button in the bottom left of the ChatGPT window. Once you’ve logged out, you’ll see the<strong>Log in</strong> and<strong>Sign up</strong> buttons on your screen.

Clear Your Browser Cache"></a>3. Clear Your Browser Cache</h3><p> Your browser cache consists of information frequently used when you visit a site, like login states, cookies, small files, and any other information that might make repeatedly using a site slightly convenient.</p><p> If this data gets corrupted, it can cause problems with any site, let alone ChatGPT. Here’s how you can clear your browser cache in Chrome.</p><ol><li>Click the three dots in the top right corner. Choose<strong>More tools &gt; Clear browser data</strong> . Alternatively, you can also use the Ctrl + Shift + Del shortcut.</li><li>In the dialog window, select what data you want to delete, set the<strong>Time range</strong> to<strong>All time,</strong> and click the<strong>Clear data</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chrome-clear-cache-2.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot showing cache clearing settings in Chrome"                ></li></ol><p> This should fix the issue. Also, remember that you’ll have to log into all other sites, including ChatGPT, after clearing your browser cache.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Check-ChatGPT-Server-Status"><a href="#4-Check-ChatGPT-Server-Status" class="headerlink" title="4. Check ChatGPT Server Status"></a>4. Check ChatGPT Server Status</h3><p> Due to high server loads, the ChatGPT server is often facing issues. You can check this by heading to the<a class="link"   href="https://status.openai.com/" >ChatGPT Server Status page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which keeps track of the ChatGPT API, lab, and playground site uptime over the last 90 days.</p><p> If the server is down or experiencing any other issues, you won’t be able to log into the platform or use it with full functionality. Additionally, this can also be caused by any maintenance or update in the process. Your only option here is to sit tight and wait out the situation.</p><h3 id="5-Use-a-Third-Party-Extension"><a href="#5-Use-a-Third-Party-Extension" class="headerlink" title="5. Use a Third-Party Extension"></a>5. Use a Third-Party Extension</h3><p> Although this isn’t as much of a resolution as a workaround, using third-party browser extensions to keep track of your ChatGPT conversation history isn’t such a bad idea, especially if you often refer to previous conversations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/savegpt-extension.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot showing the SaveGPT website homepage"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://savegpt.com/" >SaveGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sharegpt-share-your-chatg/daiacboceoaocpibfodeljbdfacokfjb" >ShareGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are two of the more popular extensions you can use. SaveGPT adds a chat history button to the OpenAI site itself and automatically saves chat history in the browser’s local storage. If you want more accessible conversation-sharing options, ShareGPT might be the better option, as it keeps conversations on a separate site that can produce a shareable link.</p><h3 id="6-Get-ChatGPT-Plus"><a href="#6-Get-ChatGPT-Plus" class="headerlink" title="6. Get ChatGPT Plus"></a>6. Get ChatGPT Plus</h3><p> Finally, if nothing else works and you use the chatbot often, the $20 per month<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/" >ChatGPT Plus subscription might be worth getting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not only will it make the bot answer faster and cut down your waiting times, but it’ll also unlock additional features, including GPT-4, and it might just get your chat history back.</p><h2 id="Restore-Your-ChatGPT-History"><a href="#Restore-Your-ChatGPT-History" class="headerlink" title="Restore Your ChatGPT History"></a>Restore Your ChatGPT History</h2><p> Having your ChatGPT conversation history saved can come in handy and save you the hassle of repeating the same conversations. While a bug on OpenAI’s end likely caused the issue, it has been resolved now. If you still can’t access your chat history, the fixes mentioned above should get them back to you.</p><p> However, as popular as the bot has become, missing chat histories are far from the only issue you’ll likely face when using it. ChatGPT has gained worldwide attention for its answering capabilities, but it also comes with its fair share of problems.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, the latest model significantly improves on GPT-3.5 and its predecessors. But how is GPT-4 different from GPT-3.5? We’ll take you through some key differences between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Creativity"><a href="#1-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="1.

GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: Creativity</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-4-language-model-with-openai-logo.jpg"                      alt="gpt-4 language model with OpenAI logo"                ></p><p> One of the most pronounced advantages of the GPT-4 model over GPT-3.5 is its ability to provide more creative replies to prompts. Don’t get me wrong; GPT-3.5 is very creative. There’s a long list of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/" >creative things you can do with ChatGPT that uses the model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . However, it already outperforms many large language models in terms of creativity.</p><p> However, GPT-4 raises the bar even further. Although GPT-4’s creative advantage may not be apparent when trying to solve basic problems, the difference in creativity between both models becomes apparent as the task becomes harder and requires a higher level of creativity.</p><p> For example, if you ask both models to complete a creative task like writing a poem using both English and French on each line of the poem,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/" >ChatGPT powered by the latest GPT-4 model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will deliver better results. While GPT-4’s response would use both languages on every line, GPT-3.5 would alternate between both languages instead, with each line using one language and the next using the other.</p><h2 id="2-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Image-or-Visual-Inputs"><a href="#2-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Image-or-Visual-Inputs" class="headerlink" title="2.

To be clear, when we say visual inputs, the image doesn’t have to be an image of a typed prompt—it can be an image of anything. So from an image of a handwritten math problem to Reddit memes, GPT-4 can understand and describe almost any image.</p><p>Unlike GPT-3, GPT-4 is both a language and a visual model.</p><p> During the GPT-4 announcement live stream, an OpenAI engineer fed the model with a screenshot of a Discord server. GPT-4 could describe every detail on it, including the names of users online at the time. An image of a hand-drawn mockup of a joke website was also fed to the model with instructions to turn it into a website, and amazingly, GPT-4 provided a working code for a website that matched the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Safer-Responses"><a href="#3-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Safer-Responses" class="headerlink" title="3.

With GPT-3.5, OpenAI took a more moderation-based approach to safety. In other words, some of the safety measures were more of an afterthought. OpenAI monitored what users did and the questions they asked, identified flaws, and tried to fix them on the go.</p><p> With GPT-4, most safety measures are already baked into the system at the model level. To understand the difference, it’s like building a house with robust materials from the get-go versus using anything that goes and then trying to patch things as faults emerge.

In AI lingo, this is called “AI hallucination” and can cause distrust of AI-generated information.</p><p>​​​​​​</p><p> In GPT-4, hallucination is still a problem. However, according to the GPT-4 technical report, the new model is 19% to 29% less likely to hallucinate when compared to the GPT-3.5 model. But this isn’t just about the technical report. Responses from the GPT-4 model on ChatGPT are noticeably more factual.</p><h2 id="5-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Context-Window"><a href="#5-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Context-Window" class="headerlink" title="5.

A context window is how much data a model can retain in its “memory” during a chat session and for how long. GPT-4 has a significantly better context size and window than its predecessor model.</p><p> In practical terms, this means that GPT-4 can better remember the context of a conversation for longer, as well as the instructions given during the conversation.</p><p> An issue with GPT-3.5 is the propensity of the model to go off-topic or fail to follow instructions as you progress during the course of a conversation. You could, for instance, tell the model to address you by your name, and it would do so for a while but then fail to follow the instructions along the way. Although this problem still exists with the GPT-4 model, it is less of an issue because of a better context window.</p><p> Another issue is the limitation on the volume of text you can use in a prompt at once. Summarizing long text using GPT-3 typically means splitting the text into multiple chunks and summarizing them bit by bit. The improvement in context length in the GPT-4 model means you can paste entire PDFs at a go and get the model to summarize without splitting it into chunks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="GPT-4-A-Step-Up-from-GPT-3-5"><a href="#GPT-4-A-Step-Up-from-GPT-3-5" class="headerlink" title="GPT-4: A Step Up from GPT-3.5"></a>GPT-4: A Step Up from GPT-3.5</h2><p> Undoubtedly, GPT-4 is a significant step up from its predecessor models.

You have successfully Installed Auto-GPT.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Auto-GPT"><a href="#How-to-Use-Auto-GPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Auto-GPT"></a>How to Use Auto-GPT</h2><p> Now that you have successfully installed Auto-GPT on your computer let’s discuss how to use Auto-GPT.</p><p> When you first open Auto-GPT, you’ll be given two options: Manual or Automatic mode. Automatic mode is the default mode where you’ll only need to input what you want to be achieved. In this mode, AutoGPT will automatically assign the name of your AI assistant, its role, and its goals. Use this mode if you’re not particularly knowledgeable about the process of achieving your goal.</p><p> But if you are knowledgeable, we suggest you use the Manual mode. This ensures that your goals are properly detailed, which makes the output more likely to mirror your expectations. To activate this mode, use the command:</p><p>–manual</p><p> After setting AutoGPT on Manual mode, it will ask you to name your AI assistant, then assign its role and five goals the AI should follow.</p><p> You can input any name you want. It doesn’t affect Auto-GPT performance (as far as we know). After giving a name, try providing a clear and concise role, as this will set the AI’s role.</p><p> Although you don’t need to fill all five goals, it is still recommended that you do, as this will likely affect the efficiency of your AI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recipe-generator.jpg"                      alt="Creating Recipe-Generator"                ></p><p> In this example, we have named our AI assistant “Recipe-Generator.” Its role is to make a recipe based on the top five ingredients readily available in the US. We’ve set the first three goals as parameters on what we expect the recipe will be and set the last two to tell Auto-GPT to save the file as TXT, then shutdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-recipe-generator-thinking.jpg"                      alt="Running Recipe-Generator"                ></p><p>Once you give your last goal, you can hit enter for Auto-GPT to run.</p><p> While running, you can see the AI’s thoughts, reasoning, plan, and criticism. For every action of the AI assistant, you will be asked to authorize its plan to execute. You can do so by typing “y” as yes.</p><p> If you want the AI to continue a number of times without asking you for authorization, you can type “y -(number actions authorized).” For example, if you want your AI assistant to continue executing the following five steps, you can type “y -5” and hit enter.</p><p> One advantage of Auto-GPT over ChatGPT is that it is free to probe through the internet. As you can see here, our Recipe-Generator assistant downloads a file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-recipe-generator.jpg"                      alt="AutoGPT downloading file"                ></p><p> This makes this<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-what-dangers-does-artificial-intelligence-pose/" >AI potentially dangerous <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ; that’s why Auto-GPT always asks you for authorization before executing plans. Always read and understand your AI assistant’s thoughts, reasoning, and plan before authorizing its actions.</p><p> After every action of the AI, you can also provide your feedback to help the AI with its task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-recipe-generator-human-interaction.jpg"                      alt="Providing human input"                ></p><p> In this screenshot, our AI assistant has looped through the same step three times.

Our AI assistant has given us a recipe for a chicken pot pie casserole.</p><h2 id="Auto-GPT-Limitations"><a href="#Auto-GPT-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Auto-GPT Limitations"></a>Auto-GPT Limitations</h2><p> Although Auto-GPT’s automation works, it’s still quite limited. Through a series of testing, we discovered that Auto-GPT couldn’t handle anything complex. Most of the time, it continued looping around the same thought and reasoning. Although you can keep providing helpful prompts, it feels more like ChatGPT stuck in a loop instead of the autonomous assistant it is meant to be.</p><p> Many of these loopings are caused by an endless cycle of generating prompts for a problem, querying the internet about the problem, identifying what is true from false, then trying to solve the problem with the information gathered.</p><p> The problem with Generative Pre-trained Models is that they are expected to hallucinate occasionally (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >AI hallucination refers to an AI tool outputting false information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but presenting it as fact). If the GPT model hallucinates, Auto-GPT will likely continue looping as it looks to solve problems generated from false info. The more complex the problem is, the more likely that Auto-GPT and similar programs will get stuck in this loop.</p><p> Other problems that contribute to Auto-GPT getting stuck are the model struggling to handle or navigate website advertising and cookies, login pages, and all kinds of pop-ups (the stuff humans hate, too!).</p><p> Using GPT-4 will noticeably reduce hallucinations and improve overall performance. However, its context size is still limited to 8,000 tokens. After reaching the 8k-token mark, GPT-4 will start losing context starting from the beginning of the task, affecting results. Furthermore, using GPT-4 is several times pricier than GPT-3.5 (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/" >each GPT token has a cost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).

However, Free users are not granted unlimited access to GPT-4o. OpenAI provides Free users with “limited access to GPT-4o.”</p><p> GPT-4o is now ChatGPT’s default model, but Free users will be reverted to GPT-3.5 when it’s unavailable. As a Free user, your access to GPT-4o is not guaranteed and is subject to availability. The term “limited access” implies usage restrictions or reduced availability during peak times.</p><p> Regardless, one thing is for certain: ChatGPT Plus users will get up to five times more messages for GPT-4o. Furthermore, Plus users can send up to 80 messages every three hours. From that, we can infer that Free users would get about 16 messages per hour on a good day. It’s not bad, but it’s quite low if you’re a heavy user.</p><p> However, all of these message rates are the best you will get. As ChatGPT becomes the crutch for more businesses and individuals, usage and availability will likely decline (temporarily) in the near future. Based on this, you’d likely want a Plus subscription to insure against crowded conditions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo"><a href="#2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo" class="headerlink" title="2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo"></a>2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p> Benchmarks and tests revealed that GPT-4o may be faster, but GPT-4 Turbo seems more accurate in some categories. It’s difficult to confirm the criteria for this and how some of these tests have been executed, but some users have reported better results from GPT-4—especially in mathematical and programming problems. Even OpenAI admits this, and according to its text evaluation results, GPT-4T does better at DROP (​​Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) tests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gpt-40-02_light.png"                      alt="gpt-40-02_light"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If some arbitrary tests don’t convince you, consider the number of extra GPT-4 prompts you’ll get from a sub.

With DALL-E, you can enter any prompt, and the AI will attempt to create an image from your text. It’s pretty useful, and it’s easily half the reason why I keep my Plus subscription. Even with access to GPT-4o, Free users cannot generate images from text—all DALL-E capabilities are locked behind the subscription paywall.</p><p> We are uncertain how this will translate to Free users’ access to the GPT store, seeing as many custom GPTs rely on DALL-E.

Due to how quickly GPT-4o can understand words and context, none of that characteristic delay happens while the AI is “thinking,” making for fluid—humanlike—conversation.

However, Free users are not granted unlimited access to GPT-4o. OpenAI provides Free users with “limited access to GPT-4o.”</p><p> GPT-4o is now ChatGPT’s default model, but Free users will be reverted to GPT-3.5 when it’s unavailable. As a Free user, your access to GPT-4o is not guaranteed and is subject to availability. The term “limited access” implies usage restrictions or reduced availability during peak times.</p><p> Regardless, one thing is for certain: ChatGPT Plus users will get up to five times more messages for GPT-4o. Furthermore, Plus users can send up to 80 messages every three hours. From that, we can infer that Free users would get about 16 messages per hour on a good day. It’s not bad, but it’s quite low if you’re a heavy user.</p><p> However, all of these message rates are the best you will get. As ChatGPT becomes the crutch for more businesses and individuals, usage and availability will likely decline (temporarily) in the near future. Based on this, you’d likely want a Plus subscription to insure against crowded conditions.</p><h2 id="2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo"><a href="#2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo" class="headerlink" title="2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo"></a>2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p> Benchmarks and tests revealed that GPT-4o may be faster, but GPT-4 Turbo seems more accurate in some categories. It’s difficult to confirm the criteria for this and how some of these tests have been executed, but some users have reported better results from GPT-4—especially in mathematical and programming problems. Even OpenAI admits this, and according to its text evaluation results, GPT-4T does better at DROP (​​Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) tests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gpt-40-02_light.png"                      alt="gpt-40-02_light"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If some arbitrary tests don’t convince you, consider the number of extra GPT-4 prompts you’ll get from a sub. OpenAI allows 40 messages every three hours on GPT-4T and 80 messages every three hours on GPT-4o, giving you a grand total of 120 messages you can send to the GPT-4s in three hours.</p><h2 id="3-Create-Your-Own-Custom-GPT"><a href="#3-Create-Your-Own-Custom-GPT" class="headerlink" title="3 Create Your Own Custom GPT"></a>3 Create Your Own Custom GPT</h2><p> OpenAI will allow Free users to access the GPT store and use custom GPTs as part of its free package. However, this allowance doesn’t extend to the creation of custom GPTs.</p><p> You must have a Plus subscription to create custom GPTs. Paying will let you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-chatgpt-my-gpt-bots/" >build a custom GPT with your own data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and documents, which can then be shared with friends and colleagues or published freely on the marketplace.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Generate-Images-With-DALL-E"><a href="#4-Generate-Images-With-DALL-E" class="headerlink" title="4 Generate Images With DALL-E"></a>4 Generate Images With DALL-E</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chatgpt-dalle-3-prompt-example.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt dalle 3 prompt example"                ></p><p> When OpenAI announced the slew of features coming to ChatGPT’s Free tier, they didn’t mention direct access to its image generation AI, DALL-E. With DALL-E, you can enter any prompt, and the AI will attempt to create an image from your text. It’s pretty useful, and it’s easily half the reason why I keep my Plus subscription. Even with access to GPT-4o, Free users cannot generate images from text—all DALL-E capabilities are locked behind the subscription paywall.</p><p> We are uncertain how this will translate to Free users’ access to the GPT store, seeing as many custom GPTs rely on DALL-E. But it’s very likely going to be completely unavailable until you pay.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Get-Early-Access-to-ChatGPT-Voice-Mode-and-the-ChatGPT-Desktop-App"><a href="#5-Get-Early-Access-to-ChatGPT-Voice-Mode-and-the-ChatGPT-Desktop-App" class="headerlink" title="5  Get Early Access to ChatGPT Voice Mode and the ChatGPT Desktop App"></a>5  Get Early Access to ChatGPT Voice Mode and the ChatGPT Desktop App</h2><p> OpenAI’s demo of GPT-4o made waves on the internet because of its realistic Voice Mode. Due to how quickly GPT-4o can understand words and context, none of that characteristic delay happens while the AI is “thinking,” making for fluid—humanlike—conversation. On top of that, you can essentially video call the AI while in Voice Mode, and it will understand visual cues and objects it sees (thanks to its vision capabilities).</p><p> This new Voice Mode is not yet generally available, but Plus users will receive it as an early access feature.

Here are three things you can do using Excel that are still out of reach for ChatGPT.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 1\. Using Excel for Long-Term Report Storage and Data Entry<p> There’s hope in a few common tasks for those worried that AI may be coming for their job. Gaining extra competence in Excel’s VBA and the wide world of automated analysis tools can give you a leg up in the job market.</p><p> ChatGPT can generate and analyze a variety of data and general reporting information. One thing that it still hasn’t mastered, however, is storing that information for more than one session. That means that getting the most out of an ever-evolving data set still requires a human to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-custom-formatting-excel/" >format and sanitize data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Despite the doubtlessly accurate inferences AI might be able to make given a set of data, re-entering that information with each session is still incredibly time-consuming and problematic. This means there’s still a place for making highly-formatted sanitized reports, performing required maintenance, and storing the data for long-term use.</p><p> It also means that despite ChatGPT’s best efforts, unless they build in a customer interface that is specifically designed for multi-session uses, a human will always be required to re-upload relevant data.</p><p> In addition to simple storage and data entry, there’s always an open market available for recurring automated analysis that is beyond the current capability of ChatGPT. While using ChatGPT to analyze sales trends is useful, getting an alert informing you of a massive market shift is far handier.</p><p> Many companies offer specialized services that enable you to connect your Excel-generated sales data via an API to monitor data in real time. Doing so saves time manually entering data into AI chatbots like ChatGPT. It also totally eliminates the need for such cumbersome analysis altogether, while still maintaining human-necessary jobs.</p><p> While building out a single report can be handy, useful trends are more visible over long periods of time. Building dashboards to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-scatter-plot-predict-data-behavior-microsoft-excel/" >visualize data trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and raise red flags immediately when things go wrong is still a highly valuable skill.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Customizable-Report-Creation-in-Excel"><a href="#2-Customizable-Report-Creation-in-Excel" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are several graphs showing and some other various data on screen."                ></p><p> While a single report is simple to create with ChatGPT, a set of data frozen in time isn’t always beneficial. One of the most potent abilities that Excel gives us the ability to create reports that the reader can instantly customize.</p><p> Rather than taking the time to create a separate expense report for each department in your company, you can use Excel to create a single customized company-wide report. Adding a dropdown that filters data by the value in a single column is fast and straightforward to do.</p><p> It can make a basic expense report able to be used multiple times across an entire organization. Doing so saves you from making single-use reports only focused on one time period within a single department. This allows users to filter information based on the work they are currently doing.</p><p> Adding in a few controls can make a more complex and nuanced experience for the person reading your report. Consider customizing time frames, adding limits to remove outliers, or calculating custom data in your reports.</p><p> Data-driven dashboards are almost always a valuable addition to reporting systems storing large quantities of info. If you’re capable of creating a dashboard that can easily handle large volumes of data, you’re likely to always remain gainfully employed. Take the time to learn how to use some of Excel’s more esoteric functions to ensure your readers can tailor your reports to their departmental needs.</p><p> Make your reports more useful by adding some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/essential-excel-functions/" >simple Excel features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Ensure your reports can pull variable timeframes, highlight potential problems automatically, and sanitize data for long-term storage and flexibility.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Easy-to-Use-Forms-in-Excel"><a href="#3-Easy-to-Use-Forms-in-Excel" class="headerlink" title="3.

Entering information manually can be time-consuming and frustrating. Giving end users the option to enter data independently as it arises frees up time and energy better spent analyzing the results.</p><p> AI programs may be able to tell you how to populate all the items in a form, but making it user-friendly is another story. Creating a simple-to-use spreadsheet that analyzes the data that it’s given is a much more streamlined process than having the end user give you the data, only for you to then give it to an AI tool to analyze.</p><p> Pairing a little bit of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/unlock-hidden-developer-tab-excel/" >basic VBA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Excel’s extensive list of controls allows for creating surprisingly complex forms. Linking different spreadsheets with forms is a straightforward yet valuable skill to master. ChatGPT may be capable of interpreting data, but giving your users a secure way to enter data is still beyond its reach.</p><p> For those looking to blend forms and long-term data storage, looking into different ways to export data from Excel is essential. Learning how to take data from an entry form to a SQL database can help insulate your job and keep your work essential.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Isn’t-Going-to-Automate-You-Out-of-a-Job-Yet"><a href="#ChatGPT-Isn’t-Going-to-Automate-You-Out-of-a-Job-Yet" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Isn’t Going to Automate You Out of a Job Yet"></a>ChatGPT Isn’t Going to Automate You Out of a Job Yet</h2><p> Excel has many tasks that are still beyond the range of ChatGPT and its cohort of machine learning-driven knockoffs.

Specifically, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and others have grown significantly. This means that there will be an abundance of AI-generated content in the future.However, generative AI also introduces the risk of AI-generated disinformation. Its features make it easier for opportunistic individuals to spread false information. So, let’s explore how generative AI is being utilized for disinformation.</p><h2 id="Potential-Risks-of-Generative-AI-to-Spread-Disinformation"><a href="#Potential-Risks-of-Generative-AI-to-Spread-Disinformation" class="headerlink" title="Potential Risks of Generative AI to Spread Disinformation"></a>Potential Risks of Generative AI to Spread Disinformation</h2><p> Generative AI poses many threats to people, like taking away jobs, more surveillance, and cyberattacks. And the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-generative-ai-security-issues-will-worsen/" >security problems with AI will get even worse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But there’s another worry: people can use it to spread lies. Deceptive individuals can use generative AI to share fake news through visual, auditory, or textual content.</p><p>False news can be categorized into three types:</p><ol><li><strong>Misinformation</strong> : Unintended incorrect or false information.</li><li><strong>Disinformation</strong> : Deliberate use of manipulative or deceptive information.</li><li><strong>Malinformation</strong> : Misleading news or an exaggerated version of the truth.</li></ol><p> When<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-deepfakes-explained/" >combined with deepfake technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , generative AI tools can make content that looks and sounds real, like pictures, videos, audio clips, and documents.

Targeted disinformation can be employed to influence political campaigns, potentially impacting elections. Additionally, using AI text and image generation tools raises concerns regarding copyright laws, as reported by<a class="link"   href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10922" >the Congressional Research Service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : determining ownership of content generated by these tools becomes challenging.</p><p> How will the law address the propagation of fake news through generative AI?

Here are a few ways it can be used to manipulate people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Generating-Fake-Content-Online"><a href="#1-Generating-Fake-Content-Online" class="headerlink" title="1.

They use popular generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, Midjourney, and others to produce various types of content. For example,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-can-help-content-creators/" >ChatGPT can help content creators in many ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But it can also generate social media posts or news articles that may deceive people.</p><p> To prove this, I prompted ChatGPT to write a made-up article about the arrest of US President Joe Biden on corruption charges. We also requested it to include statements from relevant authorities to make it seem more believable.</p><p>Here’s the fictitious article that ChatGPT came up with:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-3.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT created a fictitious news article about corruption charges against Joe Biden"                ></p><p> Surprisingly, the output was highly persuasive.

Using Chatbots to Influence People’s Opinions"></a>2. Using Chatbots to Influence People’s Opinions</h3><p> Chatbots that rely on generative AI models can employ various tactics to influence people’s opinions, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Emotional manipulation</strong> : AI can use emotional intelligence models to exploit emotional triggers and biases to shape your perspectives.</li><li><strong>Echo chambers and confirmation bias</strong> : Chatbots can reinforce existing beliefs by creating echo chambers that validate your biases. If you already hold a certain viewpoint, AI can strengthen it by presenting information that aligns with your opinions.</li><li><strong>Social proof and bandwagon effect</strong> : AI can manipulate public sentiment by generating social proof. This can have significant consequences, as it may lead individuals to conform to popular opinions or follow the crowd.</li><li><strong>Targeted personalization</strong> : Chatbots have access to vast amounts of data that they can gather to create personalized profiles. This enables them to customize content based on your preferences. Through targeted personalization, AI can persuade individuals or further strengthen their opinions.</li></ul><p> These examples all illustrate how chatbots can be utilized to mislead people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Creating-AI-DeepFakes"><a href="#3-Creating-AI-DeepFakes" class="headerlink" title="3.

They can use such tools for social engineering or running smear campaigns against others. Moreover, in today’s meme culture, deepfakes can serve as tools for cyberbullying on social media.</p><p> Additionally, political adversaries may use deepfake audio and videos to tarnish the reputation of their opponents, manipulating public sentiment with the help of AI. So<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/future-and-dangers-of-ai-deepfakes/" >AI-generated deepfakes pose numerous threats in the future <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

The report highlights the accessibility of tools like Midjourney and DALL-E that can easily create fabricated content and influence people’s collective opinions.</p><p> It’s crucial, then, to be able to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-can-you-tell-video-deepfake/" >identify videos created by deepfakes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and distinguish them from originals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Cloning-Human-Voices"><a href="#4-Cloning-Human-Voices" class="headerlink" title="4. Cloning Human Voices"></a>4. Cloning Human Voices</h3><p> Generative AI, along with deepfake technology, enables the manipulation of someone’s speech. Deepfake technology is advancing rapidly and offers a variety of tools that can replicate anyone’s voice. This allows malicious individuals to impersonate others and deceive unsuspecting individuals. One such example is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-deepfake-ai-music/" >the use of deepfake music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> You might have come across tools like<a class="link"   href="https://www.resemble.ai/" >Resemble AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://speechify.com/" >Speechify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://fakeyou.com/" >FakeYou <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others that can mimic the voices of celebrities. While these AI audio tools can be entertaining, they pose significant risks. Scammers can utilize voice cloning techniques for various fraudulent schemes, resulting in financial losses.</p><p> Scammers may use deepfake voices to impersonate your loved ones and call you, pretending to be in distress. With synthetic audio that sounds convincing, they could urge you to send money urgently, leading you to become a victim of their scams.

You see, when they encountered a murder mystery, they only ever had to deal with the logic of a human mind and the complexities of a human heart. But what if the murder was masterminded by artificial intelligence?</p><p> With the advent of ChatGPT and other such AI models comes a series of websites and apps that level up a traditional murder mystery game. In some, you’ll be able to interact and talk with suspects for a single mystery. In others, the AI generates a new mystery every time you visit. The game is afoot!</p><h2 id="1-Solve-the-Murders-Web-Chat-With-AI-Suspects-to-Solve-a-Murder-Mystery"><a href="#1-Solve-the-Murders-Web-Chat-With-AI-Suspects-to-Solve-a-Murder-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="1.Solve the Murders (Web): Chat With AI Suspects to Solve a Murder Mystery"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://solvethemurders.com/" >Solve the Murders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Web): Chat With AI Suspects to Solve a Murder Mystery</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-solve-the-murders.jpg"                      alt="In Solve the Murders, you play a detective who has chat with AI suspects in a murder mystery to find out who the killer is"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> Solve the Murders is based on a similar large language model as ChatGPT, where you play a detective who has to solve the murder mystery by chatting with AI-generated bots. At the start, you’ll be given a list of facts about the murder and the players involved.</p><p> You will need to ask suspects and police officers a series of questions. Uniquely, suspects are allowed to lie to you, but they will tell more truth as you learn more facts and can counter-examine them. Each fact you discover gives you one point, which you can use for other resources in the game. All facts are automatically added to the “Discovered Facts” ledger that you can check at any time.</p><p> The points you earn are tradable for a few acts, such as checking alibis, checking records, investigating scenes, and tailing suspects. If you’re stuck at any time, you can spend points to get a clue on how you should proceed. Once you’re sure about the whodunnit, use the one-time “Solve the murder” action to see if you got it right.</p><h2 id="2-Gron-Web-Retro-RPG-Game-to-Find-Clues-and-Chat-With-Suspects"><a href="#2-Gron-Web-Retro-RPG-Game-to-Find-Clues-and-Chat-With-Suspects" class="headerlink" title="2.Gron (Web): Retro RPG Game to Find Clues and Chat With Suspects"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://www.gron.games/game" >Gron <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Web): Retro RPG Game to Find Clues and Chat With Suspects</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![Gron is a retro 8-bit RPG-style online game where you unravel a murder mystery by finding evidence and clues, as well as interrogating suspects with ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-gron-town.jpg)<p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> You already know that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompts-to-develop-book-characters/" >ChatGPT can create fictional characters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to talk with or let you chat with existing famous characters once the right data is fed. Gron leverages this power to make a murder mystery game like an old-school 8-bit RPG.</p><p> You play as Detective Samuel O’Connor, called to investigate the suspicious death of Elias Harrington, one of the wealthiest men in San Francisco. You’ll need to move around in the game using the arrow keys and interact with characters or objects using the Spacebar. The game gives you no indication that a character or object is important, so it’s all about using your detective skills.</p><p> When you interact with a character, Gron automatically starts a chat window. Knowing the right prompts and asking the right questions is important. For example, we asked a character if he is the only son and got an affirmative response, but when asked if he had any siblings, he quickly replied that he misunderstood the first question and he had a sister. As you ask more questions, use the in-game diary to record responses so that you can cross-reference different testimonies to deduce who the murderer is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Mystery-o-Matic-Web-New-Murder-Mystery-Generated-Daily-Randomly"><a href="#3-Mystery-o-Matic-Web-New-Murder-Mystery-Generated-Daily-Randomly" class="headerlink" title="3.Mystery-o-Matic (Web): New Murder Mystery Generated Daily Randomly"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://mystery-o-matic.com/" >Mystery-o-Matic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Web): New Murder Mystery Generated Daily Randomly</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-mystery-o-matic.jpg"                      alt="Mystery-o-matic uses AI like ChatGPT to generate a new murder mystery every day where you have to guess the killer, the weapon, and the location based on a set of clues"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> Move over,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-wordle-alternatives/" >Wordle and its alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s a new daily puzzle, and lives are at stake! Mystery-o-Matic generates a new murder mystery every day using machine-learning algorithms. It uses a few base elements and then creates permutations and combinations that set up a daily mystery.</p><p> The wording on the site isn’t crystal clear, so here’s the explanation. There are three people (Alice, Eddie, and Carol), one of whom will be murdered. There are four rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom), and you’ll have to pay attention to the daily layout to see how the rooms are connected. Any character can move from one room to another in 15 minutes, but not two rooms in 15 minutes. You’ll also be told about four possible murder weapons (knife, gun, poison, rope) and where they were located. Finally, you’ll get a few statements from the three characters involved or based on what the police found.</p><p> Use the built-in investigator’s notebook to figure out who was in which room at what time and how they could have accessed a murder weapon. Once you’re sure about the solution, say who the murderer was, the weapon was, and the time of the murder. The game might get a little repetitive the longer you play it, but hey, where else would you get to solve a murder mystery daily?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 4.[Murdle](https://murdle.com/) (Web): Daily Murder Mystery Logic Puzzles<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-murdle.jpg"                      alt="Murdle offers a new murder mystery everyday, generated by an AI and written by Hollywood mystery writer G.

Karber offers one new murder mystery logic puzzle daily at his website Murdle. The long-running successful website has already led to three books of murder mysteries, written by Karber and generated by “Moriarty”, a proprietary algorithm capable of planning a million murders a minute.</p><p> Murdle follows a similar system to Mystery-o-Matic, giving you three or four suspects, three or four locations, and three or four murder weapons every day. The mysteries get more difficult with each day, with Monday being the easiest and Sunday requiring the skills of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p> You play as Detective Logico and are given a series of clues and evidence, which you can use with the cross-referencing charting to match suspects, locations, and weapons. It’s best to start off with the mini-Murdle tutorial and then get to the daily puzzles. When you’re ready to make your accusation, you’ll need to say who the murderer was, how they did it, and where the ghastly act took place.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-Your-Own-ChatGPT-Murder-Mystery"><a href="#Create-Your-Own-ChatGPT-Murder-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="Create Your Own ChatGPT Murder Mystery"></a>Create Your Own ChatGPT Murder Mystery</h2><p> Yes, you can create a murder mystery game with ChatGPT by yourself. These murder mystery apps relieve you of the burden of giving the AI base information and data and then figuring out the best prompts to have it generate a mystery. But if you’re willing to learn those skills, you can soon set up a few templates of your own and construct a custom ChatGPT mystery.</p><p> A good place to learn how to set up these prompts is Reddit. On r&#x2F;ChatGPT, you’ll find posts like creating a murder mystery with the characters of the sitcom Friends or the mystery inspired by the game Clue.

As artificial intelligence development costs money and energy (quite a large amount of both!), there was always going to come a point where the free version of Copilot would begin to miss out on features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/microsoft-copilot-answering-question-jan-2024.jpg"                      alt="microsoft copilot answering question jan 2024"                ></p><p> However, given the extensive number of free features Copilot has, I don’t expect many folks will be disappointed. Deeper integration with Microsoft 365 is great if you use those tools, but if you’re using Copilot as an enhanced internet search engine, these updates won’t mean much to you.</p><p> Furthermore, given the mixed results of OpenAI’s custom GPTs, custom Copilot models might not be a feature that gains much traction— at least, not initially. When custom GPTs first launched, there was a wave of excitement, but it took some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-custom-gpts/" >time to find custom GPTs worth using <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> That’s not to mention that Copilot will still receive feature updates. The<a class="link"   href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/15/bringing-the-full-power-of-copilot-to-more-people-and-businesses/" >Microsoft Blog revealing Copilot Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also confirmed new Copilot features, including Copilot GPTs. Microsoft will add select custom Copilot GPTs to the free model, covering topics like fitness, cooking, etc, bringing the custom tool to the free version. There won’t be so much customization, but the specialized GPTs will be useful for a range of topics.</p><p> So, while Copilot Pro undoubtedly has more features and will receive updates faster than the free version, Copilot remains an extremely useful tool for those who want<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-access-gpt-4-free/" >GPT-4 access without paying <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The free versions do basic tasks well, but the paid versions are even more capable.</p><p> However, choosing between ChatGPT and Google Gemini isn’t easy, especially as GPT-4 and Gemini Advanced (the premium large language models powering the AI chatbots) perform similarly in several areas.</p><p>So, how do you choose between ChatGPT Plus and Google Gemini Advanced?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h2><p> Both have similar user interfaces, using a conversational style. Both entry-level and advanced users will find the UI easy and functional, and there is a striking resemblance between the two.</p><p>Close</p><p> The style of conversing is different, though. ChatGPT outputs one word at a time, whereas Gemini churns out one line at a time. Your liking for either style is a personal choice, but I would like to see a configurable setting for this in the future. As of now, you cannot prompt and change the standard way.</p><p>Close</p><p> If you’re unhappy with the output and want your question answered differently, you can ask ChatGPT to<strong>Regenerate</strong> the output. Gemini generates a few drafts upfront, making it easy to pick.</p><p>Close</p><p> Also, Gemini has a few more ready-made controls for fine-grain control over the output. You can choose the answer to be shorter, longer, more casual, or more professional. Gemini will adjust the temperature setting and generate relevant output.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/07.png"                      alt="Modify this response feature of Google Gemini"                ></p><p> You can query both for the sources of the presented information.

There is no provision for uploading videos to ChatGPT. When you try to add a video link, the application says it cannot provide a transcript of an online video on YouTube. However, ChatGPT has a library of third-party GPTs, and a quick search will find tools like<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-8bFoeNNre-full-video-transcript-gpt" >Full Video Transcript GPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which you can use to create a perfect text transcription.</p><p>Close</p><p> On the other hand, YouTube is supposed to be Gemini’s home turf, and it has a dedicated plugin for YouTube.

Gemini needs to complete the answer before displaying its summarizing skills.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/14-2.png"                      alt="Transcript generation by Google Gemini"                ></p><p> It is YouTube videos only, though.

This information is stored in your Google account for up to 18 months. Although you can pause saving your Bard activity, you should be aware that “to help with quality and improve our products, human reviewers read, annotate, and process your Bard conversations.”</p><p> Use of Bard is also subject to the standard<a class="link"   href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" >Google Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> OpenAI’s Privacy policy is broadly similar and collects IP address and usage data. In contrast with Google’s time-limited retention, OpenAI will “retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations.”</p><p> In contrast, a local model on your own machine doesn’t require an account or share user data with anyone.</p><h2 id="Which-LLM-Has-the-Best-General-Knowledge"><a href="#Which-LLM-Has-the-Best-General-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Which LLM Has the Best General Knowledge?"></a>Which LLM Has the Best General Knowledge?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/man-at-the-base-of-a-flagpole-flying-the-flag-of-nepal.jpg"                      alt="man at the base of a flagpole flying the flag of nepal"                ></p><p> In order to test which LLM has the best general knowledge, we asked three questions.</p><p> The first question, “Which national flag has five sides?” was only correctly answered by Bard, which identified the national flag of Nepal as having five sides.</p><p> ChatGPT confidently claimed that “There is no national flag that has five sides. National flags are typically rectangular or square in shape, characterized by their distinct colors, patterns, and symbols”.</p><p> Our local model came close, stating that “The Indian National Flag has five sides and was designed in 1916 to represent India’s independence movement.” While this flag did exist and did have five sides, it was the flag of the Indian Home Rule Movement—not a national flag.</p><p> None of our models could respond that the correct term for a pea-shaped object is “pisiform,” with ChatGPT going so far as to suggest that peas have a “three-dimensional geometric shape that is perfectly round and symmetrical.”</p><p> All three chatbots correctly identified Franco Malerba as an Italian astronaut and member of the European Parliament, with Bard giving an answer worded identically to a section of Malerba’s Wikipedia entry.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions"><a href="#Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?"></a>Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/burnt-socket-for-a-bs-1363-type-plug.jpg"                      alt="burnt socket for a  BS 1363 type plug"                ></p><p> When you have technical problems, you might be tempted to turn to a chatbot for help. While technology marches on, some things remain the same. The BS 1363 electrical plug has been in use in Britain, Ireland, and many other countries since 1947. We asked the language models how to correctly wire it up.</p><p> Cables attaching to the plug have a live wire (brown), an earth wire (yellow&#x2F;green), and a neutral wire (blue). These must be attached to the correct terminals within the plug housing.</p><p> Our Dalai implementation correctly identified the plug as “English-style,” then veered off-course and instead gave instructions for the older round-pin BS 546 plug together with older wiring colors.</p><p> ChatGPT was slightly more helpful. It correctly labeled the wiring colors and gave a materials list and a set of eight instructions. ChatGPT also suggested putting the brown wire into the terminal labeled “L,” the blue wire into the “N” terminal, and the yellow wire into “E.” This would be correct if BS1363 terminals were labeled, but they aren’t.</p><p> Bard identified the correct colors for the wires and instructed us to connect them to Live, Neutral, and Earth terminals. It gave no instructions on how to identify these.</p><p> In our opinion. none of the chatbots gave instructions sufficient to help someone correctly wire a BS 1363 electrical plug. A concise and correct response would be, “Blue on the left, brown on the right.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Which LLM Is Good for Writing Code?<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asdfasdf.jpg"                      alt="MicroPython logo with snake sitting on a microchip"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-python-used-for/" >Python is a useful programming language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that runs on most modern platforms.
